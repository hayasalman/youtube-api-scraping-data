Hi guys,

The book launched four days ago and the support from this community has been unbelievable.

Thank you to each and everyone of you who ordered.

Your support doesn’t go unnoticed. It truly is life changing for me.

I’m already getting so many positive messages from so many of you who binged it (some of you in just a few hours!), and it’s just the best.

Alrigthty, here is a podcast I did about a month ago in Montreal with my best friend and co-writer of Talk To Strangers, Mr. Derin Emre.

Derin is just the best. He doesn’t hold back and in this one we go into where we went after leaving Yes Theory, what it was like tackling such a daunting project together, and our honest opinions about the book. 

Prepare yourself for one hell of an honest and hilarious conversation.

Love you all!",PT1H1M40S,hd,false,2023-12-08T18:00:11Z,2630,156,32

Hey all,

Three days away from launch.

And what better way to run this final mile than with my best friend and brother, Ammar. Aka Habibs.

The man who has pushed me to grow more than anyone in my life. 
The brother with whom I’ve had the lowest of lows and the highest of highs.

In this podcast we don’t hold back. We show you the hard parts of our relationship and we also share what we mean to each other.

There’s so much here. Per usual, I think you’ll love it.

Thanks for being here. Thanks for riding with me on this journey.

Next time we’ll be talking, the book will be out.

What a wild thought.

Love you so much,

Hi ladies and gents,

Wow wow wow.

DECEMBER 3RD IS SO CLOSE. 

So crazy to think about. So surreal that the launch day is nearly here.

If you want to take advantage of the preorder bonuses like our Live Q&A, raffle to join the launch party in LA, and signed copies, then make sure to preorder at http://www.seekdiscomfort.com/book before November 25th.

If you’ve already ordered or supported in any way, I FREAKING LOVE YOU.

Okay, now to the podcast. 

This is one of my best friends. You know him from our videos. This year Staffan Taylor became a full-time host and member of Yes Theory.

He embodies the Yes Theory philosophy more than anyone I’ve ever met.

There’s so much in this conversation that Staffan and I have never shared that will remind anyone watching and/or struggling that they are not alone and things will get better.

Alrighty, that’s enough from me.

Enjoy the pod!

Love ya,

Hello you lovely people,

What you’re about to watch is the equivalent of finding a never-seen-before species in the wild.

Very few people have shaped Yes Theory as much as Tom. Yet no one outside of our inner circle knows about Tom.

Tom is very private. He likes being behind the scenes.

He’s like Charlie from Charlie’s Angels.

Tom has also never done a podcast. So this is really really special…a moment I’ll cherish for the rest of my life.

We recorded this conversation a few months ago in his home of Brighton, UK.

I think you’re going to love it.

Hey everyone,

So happy to be back with you.

Two quick things:

- We have a new book launch date: December 3rd
- We will now be releasing two podcasts a week (Mondays and Thursdays)
- With everything happening in the world, the guys and I want to give back financially to foundations focused on children affected by war. More on that soon.

Alright, now this podcast…

Ben and Dave, my two guests, are not only my close friends but also my biggest inspirations.

When I was 19 I came across a show called The Buried Life. It was about four best friends (Ben, Dave, Duncan and Jonnie) crossing off their bucket list and helping others to do the same.

The Buried Life became the seed and catalyst for Yes Theory, as you’ll learn about in this episode and the book.

Getting to sit down with them to do this was a dream come true. 19 year old Matt would be bugging out if he saw this :)

I hope you’ll get as much out of this conversation as I did. SO many gems!!

Love,

Matt",PT1H43M52S,hd,false,2023-11-09T18:00:07Z,10998,376,48

Hey all,

Matt here :)

Thanks for tuning in once again. 

Today is a very exciting day…We are FINALLY showing you the book cover.

But that’s not all. In this podcast I sit down with Dez. Dez is Yes Theory’s social media editor and the brains behind the whole promotion of this book. She even designed the cover with me. All of this to say, I wouldn’t be here without her.

In this episode you’ll get to hear about what the past year has been like for us as we’ve worked to get this book out to all of you.

Hope you enjoy it! And let us know what you think of the cover in the comments!!

Love,

Matt",PT1H5M39S,hd,false,2023-10-12T17:03:07Z,10373,485,74

Hey everyone,

Thomas and I have worked through a lot behind the scenes, especially in the past six months.

It’s been really challenging, and at times our relationship was in serious jeopardy.

Thankfully, we’ve gotten through it.

In this podcast, we dive into all of it. Not just our relationship, but also how we see the world, advice for someone in their 20’s or 30’s, and reflections on our Yes Theory experience.

I’m very grateful this is real life. That my best friend and I get to do this.

Relationships take work, especially through big changes, and this one has been no different.

I hope you’ll get something out of this for your own life and for your ties with those closest to you.

Thank you for the support.

Sending you all love,

Matt

Hey all,

I wanted to introduce you to one of my best friends, Bonnie.

Bonnie is a therapist at UCLA and since 2018, has been not only a friend but also pretty much the Yes Theory team therapist.

She is a huge part of the book as she’s been an instrumental part of mine and Yes Theory’s growth.

For those of you who plan on getting the book, I think this will be especially cool since you’ll get to actually see who she is.

Enjoy!

Hey everybody,

So excited for this one :)

Pedro Paiva is the Head of Operations at Yes Theory. He’s been with us for two years.

When he first arrived, our system was in shambles. We needed someone to come in an re-organize the ship.

He’s done an incredible job since then and has become such a good friend, that I felt it would be awesome for you guys to get to know him.

This podcast is for anyone with a dream job or anyone who is curious about how things work behind the scenes here.

I think you’ll love it :)

Enjoy!

This week, Melida and I went on the grueling but fun month long journey to learning how to breakdance.  I had always wanted to learn how to breakdance, but had no idea how freeing, beautiful and inclusive both the dance and the community is.  Thank you to the two best teachers @kingflylin and @martinkiene for taking us under their wings, I can't wait to train some more and become a breakdance MASTER. :)

Special thank you to @breakdancecrew.paris for organizing this adventure, check out their page if you want to take lessons in breakdance as well, breakdancing is the best!!!

78,UCTd7KzdwnFE3lm6LCfYDmUQ,Seek Discomfort,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,Scene from Project Iceman Film,"We believe in a future where filmmakers don’t need big checks to make a big impact. 

Thanks to 4212 people from 72 countries, Project Iceman became a reality and is eligible for Best Documentary Feature at the Oscars in 2023.

Studios spend massive amounts on campaigns to get their films to the Oscars, but we know that the power of community is far greater.

The next step is to get shortlisted. To do that, we need voters to hear about Project Iceman. Please help us reach the Academy voters by sharing this in any way shape or form you can.

It’s not about the award itself but rather the incredible platform that the Academy can allow for the message of “limitations are perceptions” to reach the ones all over the world who seek to connect with their inner voice and chase their wildest dreams.

With Love,
Yes Theory

This week we celebrate 7 years since we finished our Project30 journey on YouTube in the summer of 2015, that marked the moment we realized that we wanted to spend our lives searching for fellow Seekers who dare to dream so boundlessly to uplift others. We wanted to tell their stories and give them a platform to spread their message.. Back in 2015 after project30 our community was just 2800 people who decided to follow along with the journey. now there's almost 8 million of us in 189 different countries) with 300,000 people rocking Seek Discomfort gear all over the world. Thank you for your love, support and constant inspiration all those
years. Your stories and connections kept us going.

So it's only fitting that today we're adding a new Seeker to the family!
Everyone, please meet @nellyattar! She made history last week by becoming the first Arab woman to ever summit K2 mountain, the world's 2nd highest summit and arguably it's
deadliest one. We just posted a video on our Seek Discomfort channel telling the whole story and our surprise to her with a $20,000 sponsorship check from @seek.discomfort 7 days before she
left on her summit mission in Pakistan. Watch the videos now on Seek Discomfort!

…and picked back up on our own channel called 'The Greatest Cooking Show in Human History'!!! We have a new video posted there right now, so head on over to check it out:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qy1jwHg8fQM&feature=youtu.be

This week, we had on our friend and magic enthusiast Sky Cowans from the Youtube Channel “Sky Life” and made the best vegan eggplant lasagna can buy.

Thanks @tristankevitch for filming and helping edit.
Follow us:
https://www.instagram.com/greatestcookingshow/

Recipe from: https://frommybowl.com/vegan-eggplant-lasagna/

Ingredients:
For the Lentil Filling:
 1/2 Yellow Onion, diced
 1 cup Carrot, finely diced
 14 oz Crushed tomatoes
 ¼ cup Tomato Paste
 1 cup Dry Green Lentils
 2 cups Vegetable Broth
 ½ cup Parsley, chopped
 ¼ cup Basil, chopped
 3 large Eggplant, cut into 1/2 inches
 1 ½ cup Marinara Sauce of Choice

For Vegan Ricotta:
 1 block Organic Firm Tofu, pressed
 1 cup Cashews, soaked for at least 4 hours
 2 tbsp Nutritional Yeast
 5 cloves Garlic
 Juice of 1 Lemon
 ½ tsp Lemon Zest
 1 tsp Salt
 Black Pepper, to taste

Recipe:
Preheat the oven to 375F while you prepare all of the ingredients. Line 2-3 Baking Trays with parchment paper and fill each tray with the Eggplant “coins”, so none are overlapping. Bake for 25 minutes, then remove from the oven.
In the meantime, add the diced Onion to a large pot with a splash of Water or Oil; sauté over Medium heat for 3-4 minutes, until translucent. Then, add the Carrot, Crushed Tomatoes, and Tomato Paste to the pot, stirring well. Once everything is well incorporated, add the Lentils, Vegetable Broth, Parsley, and Basil. Bring everything to a boil, then cover and simmer over low for 30 minutes.
Spread 1/2 cup of Marinara Sauce over the base of a large casserole dish, then cover it well with 1/3 of the Eggplant – try to overlap it as tightly as possible!
Layer 1: spread 1/2 of the cooked Lentil filling evenly across the Eggplant, followed by 1/3 of the Vegan Ricotta
Layer 2: add another layer of Eggplant, then follow with the remainder of the Lentils and another 1/3 of the Ricotta
Top it Off: add the remainder of the Eggplant to the Casserole, followed by the rest of the Vegan Ricotta. Pour 1 cup of Marinara Sauce over the dish, and swirl it together with the Ricotta to complete the Lasagna.
Bake the Lasagna at 375F for 35 minutes. Let the Lasagna sit for 10 minutes, then cut and serve as desired.

Ratatouille Recipe:
Ingredients:
VEGGIES
- 2 eggplants
- 6 roma tomatoes
- 2 yellow squashes
- 2 zucchinis

SAUCE
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 4 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 red bell pepper, diced
- 1 yellow bell pepper, diced
- salt, to taste
- pepper, to taste
- 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, from 8-10 leaves

HERB SEASONING
- 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, from 8-10 leaves
- 1 teaspoon garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons Chopped fresh parsley
- 2 teaspoons fresh thyme
- salt, to taste
- pepper, to taste
- 4 tablespoons olive oil

Recipe:
- Preheat the oven for 375˚F (190˚C).
- Slice the eggplant, tomatoes, squash, and zucchini into approximately ¹⁄₁₆-inch (1-mm) rounds, then set aside.
- Make the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch (30-cm) oven-safe pan over medium-high heat. - -- Sauté the onion, garlic, and bell peppers until soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, then add the crushed tomatoes. Stir until the ingredients are fully incorporated. Remove from heat, then add the basil. Stir once more, then smooth the surface of the sauce with a spatula.
- Arrange the sliced veggies in alternating patterns, (for example, eggplant, tomato, squash, zucchini) on top of the sauce from the outer edge to the middle of the pan. Season with salt and pepper.
- Make the herb seasoning: In a small bowl, mix together the basil, garlic, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper, and olive oil. Spoon the herb seasoning over the vegetables.
- Cover the pan with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover, then bake for another 20 minutes, until the vegetables are softened.
- Serve while hot as a main dish or side. The ratatouille is also excellent the next day--cover with foil and reheat in a 350˚F (180˚C) oven for 15 minutes, or simply microwave to desired temperature.

Here's the deal.. After Ammar took Seekers on adventures this year and also sponsored Nelly Attar to climb K2, I would like to also say thank you to those who support us through Seek Discomfort this holiday by taking a small group of 3 of you who purchase from Seek this Holiday on an adventure somewhere next year. We will contact the 3 adventurers by January 31st. If you have already purchased this holiday, you're already good to go :) if you'd like a chance to join me, you know where to go! ⚡️ ⚡️ ⚡️ 

🙏🏼 Thank you for making these videos possible through your support of Seek Discomfort

When it comes to what happened at the end.. It really shook me, we felt with the local team that we'd really prepared the best we could but sometimes unexpected problems like this one can happen. We've checked several times and everyone there is fine, they were really just looking for me. Nothing like this had really happened before even though I have experience traveling to Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Mauritania and I understand that there are things you can and cannot do. I went home after this trip to mentally recuperate and recharge.

We went to see a few of the country’s major cities and ancient historical sights. Our trip was very emotionally challenging but also beautiful in many ways. Meeting Syrians, hearing their stories and capturing a small part of what the country looks like today was not a simple goal but one I hope you will enjoy joining me on. Sending lots of love to all of the Syrians of the world. Thank you for welcoming me and teaching me about your culture.

Thanks Ghaidaa for the best tour I could have possibly been on. If you want to follow her stories or travel with her, follow her on instagram at https://www.instagram.com/ghaidaa_the_guide/.

Thank you Touma for helping me capture this trip! He has just released a video about what living in Syria is like, so please go watch it here (https://youtu.be/O_-8a-8bRkE) and follow his Instagram https://www.instagram.com/toumabittar/.

Thanks Fadi for opening so many doors for us to be able to see parts of the country few have been able to for a long time. Check his work out here: https://www.instagram.com/fadiassigt/

The Honey Hunters of Nepal have a 260 year-old tradition of scaling mountains in search for a rare honey only found in the Himalayas that makes people hallucinate. We travel to the depths of the country of Nepal in search for these brave people and capture their story.

These stories searching for some of the world's rawest and most authentic experiences is what I feel most excited about in this chapter of my journey as a story-teller. Super proud of this one, I hope you enjoy :)

We are so thrilled to take a serious step in the direction of enabling you who is currently watching to seek discomfort by connecting more deeply with those around you. From a stranger you just met, old friends or your family, SPARK is designed to both ignite a connection and give you ideas for adventures to go on together!

There are 200 questions and 200 ideas for adventures… We cannot wait to hear about all of the connections and adventures that will get ignited through this game ⚡️❤️ ⚡️LET’S GO!!

WOLVES:
THANK YOU to Paula and Steve from Apex Protection Project for being such dedicated wolf savers. It is people like them who dedicate their lives to the service of others whether it be people or animals that help make our planet a better place.

They need help! With both donations or volunteering in person. You can find all the info you’ll need for that here:
https://www.apexprotectionproject.org

These wolves were all abandoned by their owners as people continue to adopt them thinking having a wolf will be fun to have but it is an extremely time consuming and difficult task to raise one. Please do not contribute to this problem and instead go volunteer at a sanctuary and help them get protected in the wild.

To take action on a larger level, please take 5-10min to go to this website https://www.relistwolves.org it will give you all the info on who your legislator is, how to contact them, pre-written emails and everything you can do to help wolves, made as easy as possible for you.

This isn’t just about wolves however, it’s about all species on the planet and protecting our ecosystem. Let’s all do our parts to show we care.

This idea originated from our friend @LexieLimitless , the youngest person to travel to every country who also joined us on the trip. Her travel adventure videos are incredible highly recommend checking out her channel here! https://youtube.com/c/LexieLimitless

This was definitely one of the strangest experiences we’ve ever had. Traveling to the Damanhur community in Italy and being allowed to come document their world was a confusing and fascinating experience leaving us with more questions than answers. So we hope that you take everything in here with a big grain of salt. We got very close to not posting this story and feel we did our best to see represent our experience. Enjoy the ride…

Check out my friend @johnnyharris first story about this conflict here:
https://youtu.be/p7_TZagxjyk

Check out @nathanieldrew ‘s Channel who joined us on this trip as well.

This was probably one of the most complicated stories we've ever had to tell. For my Cypriots watching, I wish you peace and prosperity for the future. I hope you enjoyed this piece and understand that not every single detail of the story could be highlighted. I could've spent hours going into all of the intricacies of this conflict and tried to stay balance and unbiased as I simply came an observer.

Varosha is one of the largest and most tragic ghost towns on the planet. Once filled with tens of thousands of tourists every year it's been abandoned now for about 47 years... The conflict in Cyprus is far from being resolved and unfortunately is growing in complexity as the years go by. Sending hope and positivity to all the Cypriots out there, thank you for hosting me in your country.

WE'RE BACK! Weekly uploads until December then every 2 weeks! We've been filming a lot recently, it's been crazy being able to do this again. We've got lots of life updates coming along with some of the most epic adventures to date.

On this trip, Eric and Thomas head to a country in Eastern Europe that doesn't exist that calls itself Transnistria.. Considered dangerous to travel to by some familiar with the region.. They decided to travel there without any itinerary and see what they find.

This idea was submitted to us by Nick Bowlby in our Creative Internship program we hosted last year! We had 6 people from the Yes Fam pitch ideas for us every week for a few months and lots of great things came out of that, including this one. So shout-out to the Yes Fam and Nick for getting us out to this strange and unique “country”.

Thomas spent 7 days exploring around the countryside of Albania in the search for some of the abandoned bunkers left behind after the the communist dictator Enver Hoxha's brutal rule from the 1940's to the 1980's. Yet what we found after a few days was so much more than we'd originally come for. The nature, the kindness of the people and the rich history blew us away. We still left wondering what the future of these bunkers holds...

I've been fascinated with Chernobyl since the moment I read about it in history class over 10 years ago. A few months ago I had the opportunity to go explore it after a big snowfall. The stories we heard were both heartbreaking and inspiring. So excited to finally be able to share.

We were all tested for Covid multiple times before filming this episode and no one has showed any symptoms in the months following this trip.

Hi there, Thomas here. First of all, thank you for watching this piece. This was quite of a different style of video and personal story, but after having told stories about seeking discomfort 6 years and not addressed the importance of meditation as a part of that journey, I felt compelled to finally share this with you all. I truly do believe in the power of meditation. I hope that all of you watching it will slowly make it a part of your mental diet and to bit by bit, make progress towards a more peaceful you ❤️ Thank you to Headspace for supporting this video, normally, Headspace free trials are 7-14 days, so this is really special. #headspacepartner

The Mauritanian Railway, one of the world's longest and heaviest train in the world transports iron ore from a remote mining town in Mauritania to a coastal city cutting through the Sahara Desert. The ride lasts anywhere between 19-30 hours and a few brave locals use it to travel back and forth with supplies. The dangerous trek leads to several unfortunate deaths every year as people fall off the train. Thomas and his friend Drew Binsky attempt to find this train and embark on the dangerous journey through the Sahara.

Thank you to Drew Binsky for coming with me and guiding me through how to travel in this part of the world! Check out his channel here:

Thank you to our local friend Med for some of the b-roll shots of the train.

⚡️ SEEK DISCOMFORT: http://seek-discomfort.com/yes-theory

This week, I traveled to the beautiful country of Iraq.  All my life I'd heard of the war in Iraq and how dangerous it was to visit, but I wanted to go there and explore if for myself to hear the stories that didn't make it into the media.  So, along with Drew Binsky, Lexie Alford and Cory Martin, we were taken around Iraqi Kurdistan by our amazing guide, Baderkhan.

Thank you to Lexie Limitless for joining us on this crazy adventure:

After five and a half years as a host on this channel, I've decided to step away. 'Thank You' are the only two words I can muster. You, this community, have shown me nothing but endless love and support. The video goes into detail about my decision.

I'll be writing a short newsletter twice a month at www.yestheory.com/newsletter. This is the newsletter I wish my 19 year old self had when I first set out to live a fulfilling life. When you sign you'll receive lessons, tips and tricks from ten years of seeking discomfort.

I'll also be working on the book which will come out in November of this year...but more on that later.

Come follow along on the ride. We're only just getting started :)

Also, make sure to wait till the end to watch our EPIC season trailer. 

Love you all,

Matt

We highly recommend listening to Wim's new book to get the perfect in-depth explanation of his method.
ICE MAN IS BACK!
*Do not try to replicate the same challenges we do in this video*. You can however experiment with the Wim Hof Method through Wim's App or by listening to his book on Audible! If you have any acute medical conditions, consult with your doctor beforehand.

Check out Zac's version of the video on his channel Zac and Jay!

After almost 2 years after our initial documentary with Ice Man (Wim Hof) in Poland... Thomas went back to see him for another crazy adventure.

The Wim Hof method really is an incredible way to reset your mind and body. The combination of breath-work and cold-exposure helps you tap into deeper, more meditative, parts of your brain and gain more control in  your every day life.

Here's the link to the original documentary if you haven't seen it!

221,UCvK4bOhULCpmLabd2pDMtnA,Yes Theory,lPIeD2MFs8k,72 Hours With Strangers Who Have Seen Aliens,"A few months ago Ammar heard about an incredibly strange event in Massachusetts on September 1st 1969 where several people that didn’t know each other from the same town claim to have been abducted by aliens on the same evening. The story seemed so surreal and otherworldly that we had to go speak to the people directly... Here are their stories. What do you think?

We decided to write a letter dedicated to our future selves to remind ourselves of the impact we want to see in Seek Discomfort. Both today and 5 years from now.

Starting this entire channel was one giant bet, now as we look into the future. We're placing new ones to expand and increase the potential for impact that Seek Discomfort can have.

Although we've been very spotty this year with posting, we feel so grateful for the past few weeks of adventure and our amazing community.

This week only, with every purchase about $35, you'll get a Free Seeker necklace 

The World Islands. A collection of 300 man-made islands built off the coast of Dubai to resemble an outline of the EARTH FROM THE SKY… Yet, after $13 billion was spent to complete them they’ve mostly been sitting there empty... I couldn’t believe this place actually existed.

So as a first stop on my trip I flew to Dubai to understand what happened and what their future holds… What are your thoughts? Amazing or too crazy of an idea?

Thank you to @MyDubai and @VisitDubai for helping us get in touch with the creators of these islands and for letting us go out to see the restricted areas.

Hello friends, 

What a journey it's been to get here!! From leaving Egypt exactly 10 years ago, this month, to almost dying a month ago in a car accident. This film is about the journey in between and the massive role the internet played in my life. I dedicate this film to the free child in each of us to dream the biggest and wildest we can. 

And on a personal note, thank you to every single person who saw me, loved me and challenged me along the journey. 

All my love, 
Ammar
 (@ammar)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hey Guys, 
Burning Boat here! We couldn’t be more grateful for being given the opportunity to work on another Yes Theory project and especially one so personal to Ammar. Tomorrow we're releasing a super interesting in-depth podcast, featuring Ammar, about the process of making this film, so stay tuned for that! A huge thanks to everyone who helped make this project a reality!

New Seek Discomfort Summer Drop: https://www.seekdiscomfort.com/ live for only 72hrs!

This week after Death Valley hit the hottest temperature ever recorded... We decided to go and experience what 130F or 56C felt like... Both the best and worst idea we've ever had.

Does anyone read the description? I never really know to be honest. Well either way, this is Thomas and I'm a bit bored writing this so I'll just keep typing random things and see if anybody will notice. Conor was really upset that we kept him farting in the video so please ignore that part (or don't). Anyways, hope you liked the video we're actually pretty stoked with how it came out!

Check out Conor's channel here and tell him we sent you it'll make him very happy!

We didn’t really feel like we could share what was happening because we knew so many people around the world were having a harder time than we were. But making videos like usual and finding the strength to stay positive has been really hard as we’re also trying to figure out what we want for the future of this channel.

At this point in time there are still things we’re sorting out but we’re getting amped to come back to YouTube and start creating again!! 

So grateful you’re a part of the ride with us

236,UCvK4bOhULCpmLabd2pDMtnA,Yes Theory,_zEM6Fc-7NI,Time to Change.,"There are many necessary steps that need to be taken to create a more juste and fair world. Showing up at the protests and making your voices heard is a great first step, but showing up to vote BOTH locally and on a state level (where many decisions that affect our daily lives are made) as well as on a federal level, might not be the most glamorous way we create change. But bit by bit, we will find and elect the leaders we need.

We are not running any ads on this video and as of writing this, our clothing line Seek Discomfort has raised over $40,000 for the Black Lives Matter organization.

We highly recommend watching ""The 13th"" documentary about the prison system in America. It was recently posted for free on YouTube and is an amazing opener of just a small portion of the systemic racism this country experiences to this day:

He was suffering from a rare form of liver cancer and doctors had given up hope. After hearing his story, I knew I wanted to meet him. Little did I know Xavier would beat all the odds and that we would get to know each other and become brothers. 

Over three months of getting to know him, he taught me about what it means to fight for your life, to love unconditionally and to appreciate every single breath. He always wanted to start a YouTube channel and I told him that no matter what, his story would be told. He took comfort in that. Here is that story. 

I know he's here with us. I know he's watching this video and smiling at these beautiful moments we got to spend with each other. I miss him and I know I'll see him again one day. 

Thank you for watching. It means a lot to me and I know it means a lot to him.

Love,

Matt

Thank you to Skillshare for sponsoring this video! 

Yep, I travelled to what the internet deems the least visited country in the world. The reality is that the statistics behind this are far from perfect. Many of these small countries don't actually count how many people come visit. So it's very hard to really tell which country truly has the least visitors. Either way, I went to Tuvalu, which is somewhere in the bottom of the list... and my experience was shocking.

Ammar has had this dream since he's been 5 years old and in this documentary, you will hear how we accomplish it together... But not how he had originally intended it.

We want to try a totally new way for us to release a piece of content to see if this could potentially be a way for us to tackle long-form videos that can compete with the scale of Netflix. We promise this will be worth your trust and we CAN'T FREAKING WAIT for you to see this.

Spending 24 Hours with Wim Hof 2020:  https://youtu.be/rCYXM1Z0QVo

Dislaimer: The following features stunts performed either by professionals or under the supervision of professionals. Accordingly, the producers insist that no one try to recreate or re-enact any stunt or activity performed in this film.

We've admired the pioneering work of Wim Hof for years now from afar. This January however we got an opportunity to spend four days with him in the mountains of Poland. We didn't know what to expect. We had no idea that Wim was at a place in his life where he wanted to push his findings to the next level....we had no clue that we were his experiments in proving just how powerful the mind is.

If you want to learn more about Wim's method, go visit:
https://www.wimhofmethod.com

Thank you to Wim (@iceman_hof) and Enahm Hof (@enahm_hof) for making this possible and for letting us into their lives.

Thank you to our incredible producer Sky Cowans (@skycowans)  You can check out her amazing video on how this crazy adventure came together and more on her personal experience here: http://bit.ly/SkysVideo

Thank you to the amazing men behind the camera who captured the whole thing, Andreas Hem (@andreeashem), Matt Komo (@mattjkomo) and Max Rantz-Macdonald (@livetothemax).

A huge thank you to our badass team of editors and partners who crunched this documentary down in 5 days...that shit is unheard of. Our very own Thomas Dajer (@thomasdajer) and Colin and Samir (@colinandsamir).

Everything you see here is an effort of love. Thank you for watching.

It felt important to us to take some time to reflect on the year and create a piece that expressed what we learned this year. I hope you enjoy.

2. Get it before the holidays.

For the past 4 years Matt has put 'Completing a Half Ironman' on his list of biggest goals. But he's always put it off due to fear and procrastination. Until now, where, along with his friend Conor, he overcomes endless doubt, fear, uncertainty and lack of training to go compete head on in a race that once seemed impossible to him...all with only 30 days of training.

Special people to thank for making this episode happen:

Conor for always being down for the most insane challenges. Check out his YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1E5Ti2P70zZxA4osS2MhiA

Rich Roll for being both an inspiration and mentor throughout this whole process. Check out his YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/richroll66/videos

Rich also has a great podcast which you can find here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rich-roll-podcast/id582272991?mt=2)

Gina Baski and the whole Trifit team for teaching Matt the essentials and allowing him to train in their incredible gym. Visit https://trifitla.com/ to train for your triathlon.

Fuji Bikes @fujibikes for supplying both Conor and Matt with their bike. 

@andreeashem for the epic cinematography 

Thank you to @itsnicoyeager for lending us his drone for the day!

And of course, the organizers of the Ironman for putting together such a life-changing event and allowing us to film this experience.

One of the most uncomfortable things you can do is let an inanimate object control your life. It's all based on randomness, and that's the reason we chose a dice. Ammar and Thomas got to take along New Balance Lacrosse star, Trevor Baptiste, while Matt spent time in Trevor's world as a lacrosse player. Along the way of course, strangers became a part of the whole adventure. Enjoy!

Use Honey to save $$$ this holiday season at Amazon, eBay, J.Crew, Best Buy, Urban Outfitters, MVMT, and more

What would happen if you dialed a random number and convinced the person on the other end to hang out with you for a day? Who would possibly say yes to a request? And is that person someone you could trust?

We decided to find out for ourselves. And we quickly learned, once again, that the world is filled with kind, spontaneous and loving strangers. 

You just have to look around.

Thank you to Hannah for taking part in this adventure.

https://www.seekdiscomfort.com/

After 6 months, it happened. 

From a dream Ammar had in his sleep to actually bungee jumping out of a helicopter with Will Smith. 

It FREAKING happened.

Over 25,000 of you commented on his channel when we put up the challenge and it led to this. Thank YOU, YES FAM.

There are so many incredible people to thank so here they are:

The Yes Theory squad that we wouldn't be able to do any of this with, Our in-house post-production guru leader, TD @thomasdajer, our badass manager Zack @zack.thecreator and Creative Director @gracie_norton. 

Andreas Hem, the best filmmaker we've ever met. He's directed, filmed and edited a lot of the footage you see here. You can find him on his incredible YouTube channel (youtube.com/andreasahem). Tell him we say hi :)

The family and friends that came with us to the jump: Colin and Samir, Helena and Fred Brag, and Tom.

Of course, thank you to Will Smith for accepting this challenge in the first place. Without him, none of this would have been possible. He is as incredible in person as he is on the screen. A true gentleman with a great heart.

Thank you to his team @WestBrook and Overbrook for helping us put this together.

Thank you to @YouTube for trusting us with this idea and organizing the whole live production.

Thank you to everyone at Fly On The Wall @flyonthewallent and our personal producer, Brian, for putting together such a smooth and outstanding event.

Thank you to the whole stunt team including TJ White @tminusproductions for keeping Ammar and Will safe throughout.

Thank you to Alfonso Ribeiro @therealalfonsoribeiro for hosting the live event so freaking well.

Thank you to Ala Stanford @dralastanford and her medical team for checking up on Ammar and Will to make sure their health was in the right condition for the stunt.

Thank you to the Navajo Nation for allowing us to do this on their land. What an honor it was to meet some of you who call this magical place home.

The most venerable Thai monk, Phra Maha Vudhijaya Vajiramedhi, allowed us to spend a day with him and got TD to become a monk for 24 hours. He and everyone at the Center were beyond kind and welcoming and it'll definitely be an experience we'll never forget.

Peter and Jill are just recently engaged. We met them while we were out in Thailand and they were so much fun that we decided to pull a Yes Theory on them and kidnap them to give them the best honeymoon ever. Along the way, we thought we'd teach them what (little) we know about love, patience and persistence...all keys to a great marriage.

Also, big thank you to:
Baba Beach Club Phuket Hotel: @bababeachclub (Instagram)
Wann Issara: @wan.issara (Instagram)

It also turns out Jillian started her own YouTube channel but in Mandarin Chinese! If you speak Chinese or are curious, check her out at www.youtube.com/JJsays

Our editor, TD, is an introvert. He's a badass who just happens to like his own space and his own close-knit group of friends. So, we wanted him to experience some discomfort while were in Bangkok. With no money and no connections, he had to survive in the city for 24 hours. And all we can say is that we're damn proud of him for getting it done and proving to himself that he can do it.

We thought it'd be a good idea to turn our backyard in a restaurant... and invite strangers to come eat. Our goal was to end up as the #1 rated restaurant in the city of Venice, California... and give people one of the best dining experiences they've ever had!

Born to Run by Christopher McDougall changed my life and I can guarantee it will change yours. Go get audible and download that book. Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback @ammarxz on instagram. 

Ammar has struggled with discipline and focus for his whole life, so a few months ago he decided to sign-up to a marathon to force himself to train and run everyday. But as the weeks went by, his mental health deteriorated and he failed to train. He almost gave up on the marathon but 3 days before it was happening... Something incredible happened, he changed his mind and decided to chase the impossible.. Run a marathon without having trained.

I haven't been this vulnerable and felt so nervous making a video before but here it is... Lana's Instagram: @LanaBlakely and Thomas: @ThomasBrag

Thank you to Norwegian Airlines for being so convenient and letting us book Lana a ticket last second. Love ya 

If anyone out there is struggling with a heartbreak or has become closed off emotionally for whatever reason... Just realize that the first step out of it is to start trusting again. I hope this video can maybe inspire some of you out there to realize that it does get better and that you cannot let your fears make you miserable forever. So go out there and choose love over fear my friends.

Would you let a stranger throw a party at your house? Well.. With our friends Jack Coyne, Colin and Samir, we decided to put that to the test and see if we could convince someone to let us host a dinner party at their house.. That we would then invite only strangers to. Seems like a crazy idea right? Well... Watch to see where it took us.

Special love for those who read the description... Have a beautiful day y'all - Thomas

She started skiing when she was 33 years old and at the age of 82 had to give it up because of too many injuries. Ever since, her dream has been to get back on the slopes one last time. Luckily, our friends at Wish of a Lifetime heard Ellie's story and decided they'd help her achieve that goal. We were so lucky to have taken part in this adventure and want to thank our friends at Wish of a Lifetime a million times for inviting us along on this journey. 

Please please please go check out the incredible work they do to help elders live out their last wishes and get out of isolation: https://wishofalifetime.org/

If you wanna become involved with Wish of a Lifetime right now, here's what you can do LITERALLY tomorrow:

Tomorrow, February 14th, Wish of a lifetime's 5th annual CupidCrew movement will impact 20 thousand lives worldwide. CupidCrew is a movement that delivers thousands of roses to our elders around the world on Valentine’s Day. 

Join us in the fight against senior isolation tomorrow by delivering a rose to an elder in your community or by donating 14 dollars to the movement - bit.ly/2CjcwSg (if you want us to find out you did it just use the hashtag #CupidCrew and we'll make sure to check it out).

At least you'll know. So we decided to go out in the streets and challenge some strangers... by asking them to call their crushes.. and tell them they like them. Enjoy!

They're going on an amazing roadtrip together soon called the 'Traveling Good' where they'll be documenting all the good being done in the U.S. So, in order to prepare them for the trip, we decided to handcuff them for 24 hours. What ensued was just purely hysterical. Enjoy!

Thanks to Audible for sponsoring this video. 

The freaking awesome books Ammar is listening to on Audible:
-Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg
-Willpower by Roy Baumeister

Matt's Book Recommendations:
-Ego is the Enemy by Ryan Holiday
-Born To Run by Chris Mcdougall
-Rework by Jason Fried
-Start Something That Matters by Blake Mycoskie
-The Promise of a Pencil by Adam Braun

We've always wanted to do an epic road trip to Mexico. But we figured it'd be even more awesome if we got a stranger to come along with us and take part in the adventure. So we did just that. It was surreal getting into a brand new country with a brand new friend.

Until The Ribbon Breaks is our favorite band and several months ago, through a friend, we met its frontman, Pete Lawrie-Winfield.

One day, he sat down with us in our backyard and told us his story... And we just couldn't keep it to ourselves. The world needed to know not only about his music (which is out of this freaking world) but about what he's been through, what he's learned and the incredible person he's become. 

Thanks for watching.

At Yes Theory, we make videos about experiences that get us out of our comfort zone to show people the value of saying YES. In this new series, we are behind the camera to feature other peoples' incredible stories of saying yes and the impact that it created in their lives.

We're not professional rooftoppers like so many people you see on YouTube so we approached this like amateurs and made the most fun out of it. Our goal was simply to see the best view of Paris that we could. 

Leaving a like and comment on the video makes our day so thank you for that if you do. We love you guys.

Our friend Brendan North is Logan Paul's videographer and when he was going away for Thanksgiving, he asked if we'd be interested in covering for him. We took that quite literally and decided to become roommates with Logan for a day and night and see what that would be like. The result was pretty hilarious and the experience was out of this world. Hope you enjoy!

Hi everyone, we know there's been a sad tone on our channel this week but rest assured... On Tuesday we're back with sneaking in, wheel of discomfort and adventures with strangers... It's going to be NUTS! We just had to get these two stories out.

This situation with Ammar in Egypt is very complicated, we hope you understand the situation and appreciate TD's amazing piece at the end. Some of you might not agree with Ammar's decision to stay in the U.S. but at the end of the of day, it's his and his only. Having this emotional weight over our shoulders while traveling in Egypt did make it harder to focus on videos sometimes but it was a trip that was necessary for us all.

The Super 8-effect and music choice was completely inspired by Adrian Bliss and his amazing piece:

Alright guys, we've been uploading 2 videos a week for about 8 months in a row now. It's been a crazy ride to sustain since many of our videos take several days to film, but it's been an incredible ride. Our goal is to INCREASE the number of videos we post on this channel with a TON new ideas. The problem is we don't have time to plan out these new ideas right now and we also don't have the editing resources to handle the production value we want to accomplish. SO, we are scaling back to 1 weekly video on Sundays for about 4-6 weeks until we create a sustainable system.. then we'll eventually start scaling up to 2-3 and then potentially more... Lot's of exciting things ahead and we're glad you're coming along with us.

NOW, we're also SO hyped to release 5 Project 30 episodes a week from Monday-Friday on Instagram. They're made to be watched on your phone so Instagram was the perfect home for these episodes. Can't wait to see you there! www.instagram.com/yestheory

If you scroll our channel you’ll see it’s all about positivity… So to give back to you… Watch until the very end we have a gift for you! Much love.

Now to our viewers! We hesitated posting this crazy experience for a while since we felt more intrusive than we had wished even though Matt tried so hard to make people dance!!

Obviously we don’t encourage you to do this, it was honestly pretty scary and there’s more fun parties with less stakes to sneak into :) Much love to you all!!

It's easy to think that you can only have fun once you make enough money but what we've learned in our last two years together is that it is truly possible to have an incredible time with no money.

So, we hope this inspires you to go out and chase adventure without waiting till your older or you have this or that. Go, now!

Our friend Markian helped us surprise a Yes Fam member, Sammy. We decided that together, we'd do the most uncomfortable thing we could think of: laughing out loud as hard as we could, in public. We did it around the USC Campus. It was hilarious, awkward and amazing all at the same time. And Sammy killed it! We had such a blast. Hope you enjoy!

We spend A LOT of time thinking about originality and creativity on YouTube. We're obviously not claiming that we've got it all figured out but we constantly challenge ourselves creatively and personally to come up with new fresh ideas. Trying to do something different has surprisingly slowed us down on YouTube, but with time it became appreciated and we're going to continue pushing ourselves to become better creators and better human beings. Don't miss out on tomorrow's secret announcement by turning on the post notifications :) also I PROMISE you will be blown away by Sunday's episode. Our backyard has turned into a piece of art.

A few months ago we went to visit the incredible abandoned city called Slab City. It used to be a military base but hundreds of squatters came and made it their home. We went with our friend Justin Escalona and truly had a fascinating experience. We thought the place would be hostile and dangerous when in fact it was inviting and beautiful (in it's own way). Shout-outs to all the description readers out there you know we love you :)

Millwall Football is notorious for having the craziest fans. Based in the UK, this football team has experienced 100 years of hooligans, fist fights, deaths and riots. So of course, we wanted to see what it was all about. We were in London back in September, and hopped on a train to Millwall to try and join the hooligan section and start a chant. Let's just say we we were freaking out the entire time. The only way to blend in was to be the craziest person there. Hope you enjoy :)

448,UCvK4bOhULCpmLabd2pDMtnA,Yes Theory,v6hmlzM0muE,WE SHARED OUR BIGGEST INSECURITIES IN PUBLIC | Yes Theory,"What's YOUR biggest insecurity/fear? Comment!

As a way to overcome our biggest insecurities we decided to share them with strangers in public on the Santa Monica Pier.

Yes Theory are four friends from four different countries who constantly seek discomfort in order to grow. Ammar, Thomas, Matt and Derin met in Montreal, Canada in the summer of 2015 and bonded over their shared desire to live a life that challenged and excited them. Fast forward to a year later, the team is now based out of Los Angeles, making a show on Snapchat Discover every Sunday on the Brother Channel.

Enjoy!

Our simple message of love, co-existence and tolerance was very important to us and we're happy so many people were touched by it. As the past few days unfolded we realized our video was being watched but we weren't sure if it was being heard. So as a means for YOU to truly choose Love Over Fear, we want you to manifest in real life. Whether it is talking to a stranger at the bus stop, in line at the grocery store or any setting you feel comfortable with. We want you and all of us to realize that EVERYONE is afraid to some degree. Ammar is afraid of people attacking his religion when in fact there are 1.6 billion muslims on the planet exercising their belief peacefully. Matt and Thomas were afraid because they have both lived in Paris and have friends and family that still lives there... If we realize that these attacks affects us all and TALK about it... Maybe, just maybe, we will truly all choose Love Over Fear. Thank you.

Love to you all.

But this week, we had to share a bigger message... We're Ammar, Thomas, Matt and Derin and are from 4 different countries and were particularly affected by the ISIS terror attacks from these past few weeks.

At a desperate time, we felt like the most important thing to remember is that we let them win if we divide ourselves... As people we have to stay strong and stay together.

One of our favorite adventures by far. 

Jared Morgenstern was the third designer to join Facebook. He was also the product manager who launched the the ""Like"" button for the social network in 2009.

In our episode with Jared, he shared his perspective on the ""Like"" button and told us some insider stories about the early days of Facebook and his work with Mark Zuckerberg. But it doesn't end there...We made Jared get out of his comfort zone and do something he's never done before. Watch the episode and tell us what you thought!

If you are interested in Jared's story on how he helped create the like button then you should probably click here: https://medium.com/@jjflex/hi-guys-the-like-button-d3b326a111dc#.lapzucr2s

Daniel Craig is rumoured to be retiring as James Bond after Spectre. We were given the opportunity to be James Bond for a day by the amazing BlueBoard team... But we decided to use this opportunity to make an audition tape and send it to Pinewood Studios and EON Productions, that produce James Bond..

HUGE SHOUT-OUTS to Kevin, Taylor, Erica and the entire BlueBoard team who gave us the best week-end of our lives.

http://www.michaelpicton.com/
I do not own any of this music, I'm just a huge fan of his work. All rights belong to Michael Picton. Check out his iTunes here:
https://itunes.apple.com/ca/artist/michael-picton/id438500164

100% Inspired by one of my FAVORITE documentaries ever on YouTube:
""The accidental sea"":
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otIU6Py4K_A
Go watch it and check out Ransom Riggs' (the director's) book:
http://www.amazon.com/Miss-Peregrines-Home-Peculiar-Children/dp/1594746036/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1404317948&sr=8-3&keywords=ransom+riggs

I'm a huge fan of everything he's ever done so I hope he finds this one day! :)

This week however, an old friend of mine got diagnosed with bone cancer so we weren't able to produce a comedy skit. We've been spoiled with support and love for the past few months so this week we want to dedicate all of that attention to someone who really needs it.

Please use the comments to send him positivity, strength and smiles!!

Thanks for watching everyone.
