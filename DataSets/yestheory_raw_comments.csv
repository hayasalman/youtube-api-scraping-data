66,CsXUzFvnyO4,lmfao at logan tho
67,CsXUzFvnyO4,"I dont think these shorts work, as they dont get that many views while they have been promoted quite a lot"
68,OPY6ZFPZ8lk,suggestion: also provide the video link in description
69,OPY6ZFPZ8lk,"I feel like you guys aren't using the shorts format properly for your brand. Your adventures don't fit into shorts, as they're largely about the wider context and emotion that goes into the whole story of the vids. Because of this, and because of the way the vids were originally filmed, the essence of the story is turned into what feels like a cheap little tale rather than the meaningful adventure they were supposed as.

To remedy this you could, a) stop making shorts, or b) reframe your shorts so that instead of trying to get the whole adventure into a minute, you used them as trailers to your videos. Heck, another commenter on this video actually THINKS this IS a trailer. Imagine if you actually made it into one, intentionally.

Anyway, love from the UK. Peace!"
70,OPY6ZFPZ8lk,Is the full video gonna be released soon?
71,OPY6ZFPZ8lk,I want to work for u guys.!!!!! 😂😂😂

120,Bfm2zc3Fh8s,The first video I ever watched of yes theory and it was love at first glance 😂
121,Bfm2zc3Fh8s,This full video on your page is probably the most emotional/adventurous and stunning frame wise. But the entire channel is basically my favorite of all time in the history of YouTube. I feel we will be good friends later in life. Stay safe and healthy and follow your dreams
122,Bfm2zc3Fh8s,Honestly that still is one of my favourite videos ever

138,0pKRAwlf_Xs,"I remember,  I cried the first time."
139,0pKRAwlf_Xs,That's beautiful
140,0pKRAwlf_Xs,"What a sad place is humanity without God... When you die, you're gone.
What a sad life is to live without Jesus, you're just awaiting nothing.

Let's pray for her to find Jesus and to have eternal life!"

142,0pKRAwlf_Xs,Watched the full video a few hours ago and it turly was a heart warming video . I really got chocked up some and little water eyed . If some people haven't seen the full video yet . I would really recommend watching it . Thanks Yes theory for sharing such a wonderful and beautiful and heart warming video for people to enjoy .

154,f9zemgF-LdE,"Come back to australia, go to vivid sydney"
155,f9zemgF-LdE,First 500 subs omg 😱!
156,f9zemgF-LdE,"It was a really enjoyable series in Ireland, and please go to Greece for the next one. I feel like the beauty of Greece has really been forgotten by the economic crisis, and it would be amazing to see you in my home country doing activities. If you decide you want to go there I recommend you some nice places to visit, that aren't that popular. For example: Mount Athos in the third peninsula of Chalkidiki,  Castle of Rhodes, Corfu, Oracle of Delphi, and  Island of Hydra where they use Mules instead of cars. Anyways, really enjoyed this series and wish you all good luck for your next adventure."
157,f9zemgF-LdE,Honestly its crazy that these islands exist
158,f9zemgF-LdE,Crazy he actually had an island all for himself.
159,f9zemgF-LdE,Its so weird seeing these shorts without many likes and views

176,GYVfAVmX8pQ,"So interesting to hear Derin’s point of view.  I think it is great Matt that you asked Derin to help you with the book.  Double closure for both you on your adventure with yes theory.  What I see foremost is your sincere friendship.  To be able to speak up the truth to someone, to be able to trust that person, that is a beautiful adventure in itself.  Waiting for my book!  Maybe I’ll meet you in Montreal someday!  Wish you all the best in your future projects to both of you guys!"
177,GYVfAVmX8pQ,This was very insightful.  Beautiful guys 🤍
178,GYVfAVmX8pQ,Podcast for the drive home! Have a great weekend
179,GYVfAVmX8pQ,Apparently there is a hold up with UK deliveries! Anyone else having trouble? Hope it’s not to long! Looking forward to it
180,GYVfAVmX8pQ,Love this open and direct conversation between you two! I've been wondering about this behind the doors to Yes Theory and I think Derin explained it so well from his perspective of why it doesn't fit for everyone and why it's okay. I also like how he views seeking discomfort - that it doesn't have to mean skidiving every day. I think I understand much better now your reasons for leaving. Great episode! Looking forward to receive the book already! All the best Matt for the journey ahead and enjoy the well-deserved rest!
181,GYVfAVmX8pQ,how Derin ended up is my nightmare
182,GYVfAVmX8pQ,❤❤❤
183,GYVfAVmX8pQ,"Just finished the book and right after, watched this podcast🫶🏻
Congrats to you both, and Matt, I wish you beautiful life in the years to come🫶 
I liked the book a lot, laughed and teared up...as Derin said, it is easygoing read, well done!"
184,GYVfAVmX8pQ,"Thank you Matt, thank you Derin for your honesty and for living the life you desire. I just read Tao te king from Lao Tseu, maybe you have it Derin. If not, let's open these pages that bring so much energy! I am happy to be able to read yours soon. Just waiting for it to cross the ocean ! Take care"
185,GYVfAVmX8pQ,"Derin, there is a library near you 🤓📚"
186,GYVfAVmX8pQ,"Congratulations to you both! Derin, I hope you got out of your comfort zone and celebrated a little bit 😉 Loved hearing about all the behind the scenes of writing the book together, what an accomplishment. It was lovely meeting you both at the Montreal book meet up, such a wholesome evening🥰 Impatiently waiting for my copy to arrive and dive in😊"
187,GYVfAVmX8pQ,I'm a Yes Theory OG and y'all are my favorite two people from this channel. I wish you guys well and hope to meet y'all someday. My book is on its way
188,GYVfAVmX8pQ,I totally resonate with Derin‘s personality and work story. 😍
189,GYVfAVmX8pQ,❤❤❤
190,GYVfAVmX8pQ,"Wow Derin speaks very directly and sometimes it comes off as a bit hurtful, to my ears at least. Both of you be proud of what you’ve done!"
191,GYVfAVmX8pQ,"Love Derin! Also, one of those is my signed copy!"
192,GYVfAVmX8pQ,"hey matt i read the book and SO well written. it made me ugly cry SO HARD in some parts. you made your pain really come trough but also your joy. i also didn't expect how funny sometimes the writing can be . you can tell you guys put alot of thought and were very smart in cutting the ""fat"" of the story. almost like a movie script (makes sense since daron writes scripts). good job and enjoy your rest!"
193,GYVfAVmX8pQ,"Guys, this is our 2nd to last episode of Matt's Going Away Party 🥲 Just thought I'd give you a heads up. LOVE YOU ALL!"
194,GYVfAVmX8pQ,I literally just finished the book!!!! Did Derin end up getting Canadian citizenship? ❤
195,GYVfAVmX8pQ,Can't wait for my copy to arrive
196,dHtcA3yN_Go,Why am i tearing up even before hitting on play 😅😢
197,dHtcA3yN_Go,"NYT bestseller, baby!"
198,dHtcA3yN_Go,You guys 👦 are amazing good luck on your life journey 🎉🎉🎉🎉
199,dHtcA3yN_Go,You guys are tryimg very hard to remain relevant while you are undergoing a self dismantling. It Is What It Is.
200,dHtcA3yN_Go,mine copy was bought for a month now
201,dHtcA3yN_Go,No alcohol? Really? That’s my kind of party!! 🙌🙌🥳🤩🥰
202,dHtcA3yN_Go,The hug the arms around each other..like the ironman..so great...thank you..❤❤ back flip 2.0 it will be..🎉😅
203,dHtcA3yN_Go,جاء جبريل إلى النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم فقال: يامحمد عش ماشئت فإنك ميت واعمل ماشئت فإنك مجزى به وأحبب من شئت فإنك مفارقه وأعلم أن شرف المؤمن صلاته بالليل وعزه استغناؤه عن الناس
204,dHtcA3yN_Go,"You guys made me into who I am today. I was so shy, so anxious and so scared of the world before. My 14 yr old self would not believe how far I've come, and a large part of it is thanks to Yes Theory. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You all deserve the best possible life, whatever that may look like."
205,dHtcA3yN_Go,Love you both and Yes Theory. Been watching Yes Theory since the beginning. So proud of all your accomplishments and always inspired by you all. 💕
206,dHtcA3yN_Go,"I feel like Ammar gives the best hugs in the world 

Soulmates💛"
207,dHtcA3yN_Go,"I think Matt really needs to feel valued. Not so much by others but by himself first. And to feel this way, he has to go his own way, build something from scratch outside of Yes Theory, and be proud of it. But that path will have to be a resilient one so good luck!"
208,dHtcA3yN_Go,Anyone has any idea where Tommy is?
209,dHtcA3yN_Go,I wonder if you guys considering getting Derin into Podcast? I am a Turkish guy who lives in Canada. I am really excited to hear the part of his side of the YES THEORY. :)
210,dHtcA3yN_Go,"You guys gave us a perspective we wouldn't see it fully over the years by going places and meeting people as well as showing us a stranger is a friend you just haven't met yet, ..... so thanks a lot ...... love your brotherly bond, it is big and real .... love you guys .... ❤❤❤"
211,dHtcA3yN_Go,this was so beautiful.
212,dHtcA3yN_Go,"I just wanna say: thanks for doing this. I think you should know how much you guys have helped in the struggles people have in this day and age. Many of the things you share can be reflected upon ones own experiences and friendships. So hearing these things from such inspiring people like you is truly heartwarming. I'm not even sure if you guys realise how much impact you make. Not even necissarily through the Yes Theory 'brand', but through yourselves as human beings. I've orderdered three books, of which two I will gift to two of my best friends, whom with I share a very similar friendship like you guys do in my opinion. I haven't even read the book yet, but I wanna finish with one last note: you have been so inspiring and made me think of life and goals from such a different perspective. It feels like guys give that last gentle push in actually following your gut, seek discomfort, pursuing ones dreams. You actually change peoples lives. Thanks so much for that."
213,dHtcA3yN_Go,Beautiful podcast. Enjoyed this conversation. I've been enjoying all of them so far but this one definitely a little more so even. As far as China I mean it's just governments ... Powerful people wanting more power. People are people. Much love.
214,dHtcA3yN_Go,They the cutest ❤😊 but also get a room 😂jks jks
215,dHtcA3yN_Go,AMMAR TALK ABOUT YOUR BOYFRIEND AND WHAT DID YOU DO TO THE TWO BOYS IN EGYPT
216,qG2b47HrRys,"Hey guys! Thank you for watching this episode with our ultra light beam, Staffan! 
We noticed the glitch in the intro and wanted to apologize. It only last for a few moments, so no worries on it happening during the episode. :)

Enjoy!"
217,qG2b47HrRys,"Staffan feels like the embodiment of John Lennon's song, Imagine. ""you may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday you'll join us..."" <3"

222,qG2b47HrRys,"""Trusting a future that did not exist yet""..dreaming..visions..plans as a chlld and still when under threat. Oh man Staffan..so much recognize myself in you..only that is of so much value for me now in darker period after I thought the light was on after 55 years being 'prisoner' of another family-related relationshp disorder&trauma...(but others want(ed) to put it out again and still depended on them)..Thank you..❤❤"
223,qG2b47HrRys,"Wow. Staffan, continue to shine your light ✨ Your experience and how you  express your journey and spread this knowledge to others is truly a gift. I’m so grateful to have listened to this conversation. Matt, thank you for opening up a platform in the form of this podcast to dive deeper into different topics and discussions. It’s given me more insight on why you all do what you do collectively and individually. I’m excited to purchase your book and get to know more about your journey and message. Thank you guys for being who you are! 🙏🫶✨"
224,qG2b47HrRys,22:04 Staffan really popped off here describing what a friend is and should be. Beautiful stuff man
225,qG2b47HrRys,"8:21 ""We are too small to decide what life is going to give to us."" 👏👏"
226,qG2b47HrRys,What a precious angel he is! Giving hope to humanity!
227,qG2b47HrRys,"Hi Stefan,
thank you for mentioning some of your background story. This tiny little insight of your past gives me hope and encurages me."
228,qG2b47HrRys,"Incredible interview. The vulnerability, wisdom and authenticity emanating from you two are unreal. It's rare and so refreshing to see. Thanks to both of you for being so raw and relatable x

P.S. Staffan is such an inspiring ray of sunshine!"
229,qG2b47HrRys,Staffan is such a gift to the world.
230,qG2b47HrRys,Staffan makes everyone feel like we are not alone. He wants everyone to connect. I dream of being the female Staffan lol my goal is to be an amazing thoughtful loving person like you Staffan. You have saved so many people. You saved me
231,qG2b47HrRys,"Yes! Thank you so much for this interview, I just got it recommended by a friend because he realized I was talking about similar things 😍 I really feel this."
232,qG2b47HrRys,Steffan should do a podcast with a stranger once a month somewhere on an SD adventure. Just a friend he hasn’t met yet!
233,qG2b47HrRys,"Hi, thanks for sharing your struggles and stories. I feel sometimes it takes more courage to talk about pain than to show up strongly. Glad that you find where you belong after all those struggles and you still hold that value you believe."
234,qG2b47HrRys,So powerful
235,qG2b47HrRys,This brought back so much emotions that I literally had to go to the video where this all started 4 years ago and rewatch it
236,tr2wJ_xEGmE,"I have to say that I'm trying not to watch all the videos as soon as they come out just to keep the idea that the end is not that close. But I can't, I will get updated today.  Thank you so much for bringing this episode, so genuine, so interesting and so full of very good facts. It makes me understand better why the Yes Theory idea has impacted my life so deeply, and why it keeps doing it. I can not think enough of how much I will miss you Matt. Thanks for this episode and as always, for your heart on it. I LOVE YOU❤"
237,tr2wJ_xEGmE,"Now we know how cool he is, and one of the reasons is because of the burrito blanket! 🌯🤩"
238,tr2wJ_xEGmE,"Matt you should really start by formally introducing your guests. I want to be interested right away, but like who am I even listening to? Ok he is a yes theory investor but who is he? Would be better to frame the conversation before he dives into his life story"
239,tr2wJ_xEGmE,"Tom is such an interesting guy.  Probably my favorite podcast so far.  Thanks to him for accepting and thanks to you, Matt, for making an amazing podcast choice :)"
240,tr2wJ_xEGmE,"Tom seems as genuine and loveable as the rest of the Yes Theory Family, and is clearly an extremely effective professional. 

Very excited to read this book ❤"
241,tr2wJ_xEGmE,Love you matt❤
242,tr2wJ_xEGmE,wow what a refreshing guy! He’s got that no bs vibe but with the classic yes theory kindness all of the members have . It makes sense why he’s such a core part of yes theory
243,tr2wJ_xEGmE,The love story is real ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😭
244,tr2wJ_xEGmE,"Not to take away credit to yes theory guys, but the people they have around are fundamental to their success. It’s like a machine."
245,tr2wJ_xEGmE,This was such a valuable episode! Wish we could all have a Tom of our own but appreciate the wisdom he shared here. Thanks to both of your gentle spirits for sharing your experiences. I hope it has been cathartic for you Matt!
246,tr2wJ_xEGmE,Very I nteresting to get a glimpse of the behind the scene of the start of Yes theorie.  We really feel that Tom reeeally cares about Yes theory and you guys.  He is the mentor and guardian angel of yes theory. You were lucky to have him but you guys sweat and did the great job 👌
247,tr2wJ_xEGmE,"How Tom is looking at Matt is so pure and real ! I understand why the word ""dad"" came during the  conversation. He is here for you, and at the same time he gives you the space you need to grow ! Merci pour le partage"
248,tr2wJ_xEGmE,love these! cheers matt
249,tr2wJ_xEGmE,We love Tom 🫶🏻❤️ thank you for sharing
250,tr2wJ_xEGmE,"Every time you see Tom from now onwards, you have to say 'All-Right Boyo' 😂🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿"
251,tr2wJ_xEGmE,Tom is ICONIC
252,tr2wJ_xEGmE,Loving your vibe!
253,tr2wJ_xEGmE,I love this content and everything that you share from behind the scenes! Thank you for these podcasts! I am so excited for your journey. Please take us with you ❤
254,tr2wJ_xEGmE,love this!!
255,tr2wJ_xEGmE,Finally! Thomas spoke a lot about Tom during the live cohort 🤩
256,yF2bCT2i5ZU,"what a fantastic retrospective, magical serendipity you can feel the vibes"
257,yF2bCT2i5ZU,Yes Theory and TBL teaming up to make a documentary called The Ripple Effect…. This will be the greatest documentary ever
258,yF2bCT2i5ZU,"when matt asked ""did you feel it too?"" im here like ""YES, I FELT IT TOO"". This conversation was so brilliant."
259,yF2bCT2i5ZU,so much knowledge in this episode. 3 persons who decided to push themselves and achieve what it felt like impossible.
260,yF2bCT2i5ZU,Matt has 3 brothers? bruh that house must ve been chaos
261,yF2bCT2i5ZU,When Matt said “you get high from it a little bit” … so the way I see it is… when you talk to people of your same vibe and talk about things that inspire you and make you feel so alive— that’s what happens. It’s like a spiritual thing. It awakens you again and lights you up. You feel so connected and at ease like everything make sense.
262,yF2bCT2i5ZU,"I feel SO inspired right now!!! Also, something was said that was very healing for me. Loved this so much. I was sad for it to end because I was just so loving this video."
263,yF2bCT2i5ZU,by far my favorite episode
264,yF2bCT2i5ZU,"this was such a different era of TV and MTV. i loved coming home from school to watch the buried life episodes i had recorded on the DVR.... i had the biggest crush on ben back then!! so glad to see you guys are friends, it makes sense.  two generations of the same philosophy."
265,yF2bCT2i5ZU,"This is one of the most hype pods I’ve ever seen, such incredible and inspirational stories, absolutely cannot wait to see that documentary 🙏🏼❤️"
266,yF2bCT2i5ZU,man on the right is so sexy
267,yF2bCT2i5ZU,Where can you watch the buried life without paying an arm and a leg or having a subscription?
268,yF2bCT2i5ZU,So excited for the ripple effect doc !! Im gonna back and watch the buried life and rewatch project30 to see the influence these guys had on them. Thanks for introducing these incredible guys to us Matt!
269,yF2bCT2i5ZU,"This is on another level, so inspiring, you guys are legends ❤ The ripple effect makes so much sense and continues, full circle moment!"
270,yF2bCT2i5ZU,1:39:24 - outcome independence!! Yes Matt!!
271,yF2bCT2i5ZU,"This podcast is so underrated. I truly think this episode could help tons of young adults trying to find their ""purpose"" or ""meaning"" in life. It's so subjective. Find what you love by trying things and continue to do them if they make you happy. There are no rules!"
272,yF2bCT2i5ZU,"1:20:20 - amazingly put!!! Don't worry too much about what your purpose is in life, just follow what it is that you want to be doing now :)"
273,yF2bCT2i5ZU,So damn inspiring!! You are all freaking legends.
274,yF2bCT2i5ZU,"Wow, this might be the most powerful episode of the podcast yet for me. ""I became in love with the adventure of finding out what the next adventure is."" Love this reframe. Going to hold that quote tight whenever I forget to enjoy the process of trying things and having fun before I die."
275,yF2bCT2i5ZU,"After watching the buried life, I quit my job, got an RV and traveling the United States for 3 months exploring exploring the landscapes, meeting people, different non profit organizations. These guys changed my life."
276,PZTdXbG-0Jc,Stay in the moment. Be thankful for where you are. Pause and reflect always.
277,NKsYrkoPgq0,"If you have any ideas on how we can help, let us know."
278,NKsYrkoPgq0,From the river to the sea !!!!!
279,NKsYrkoPgq0,🫶🏻🇵🇸🌎🌍🌏☮️🕊️🫶🏻
280,NKsYrkoPgq0,Saying NO to genocide isn't that hard.
281,NKsYrkoPgq0,Love over war merch drop? with all donations going to the people most affected?
282,NKsYrkoPgq0,Honestly feels like your hearts are going out to one very specific side of this community smh
283,NKsYrkoPgq0,I'm a big fan. I live in Israel. I was wondering what you're going to say. Nas Daily has responded beautifully.
284,NKsYrkoPgq0,"I live in Israel and have been thinking a lot during these times about the two modes people can live an act in - love and fear. Still not able to process the horrifying acts of terror which took place... 
I feel for all people affected by the attacks and the war, thinking of all of the people who are hurting and suffering and hoping that we can save as many lives as possible and end this with as little aded suffering as we can for all people, Israelis Palestinians and others. Let there be love❤"
285,NKsYrkoPgq0,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lYPBwZdJ8U
Love Over Fear, for Israel, Palestine and the whole world."
286,NKsYrkoPgq0,FREE PALESTINEEEEEE
287,NKsYrkoPgq0,Love over fear 🫶
288,NKsYrkoPgq0,#We stand with Israel!
289,NKsYrkoPgq0,"Thanks for posting this Mat, as an Israeli it means a lot. Thank you.
I do have to say I'm personally disappointed by Ammar. It's clear to me that your message as Yes Theory is love and peace, but unfortunately Ammar only posts on his IG things that encourage people to hate Israelis. For example he only mentioned Palestinian casualties and not Israeli. Also all his stories are anti Israel. It makes me feel that he doesn't live the motto ""love over fear"".

Anyway thanks again for posting this, and I'm looking forward to the video."
290,NKsYrkoPgq0,Just an idea: keep releasing the podcast and videos but give the earnings to humanitarian help in the area + have links to where people can donate on the videos. There isn’t much else you can do in my eyes
291,NKsYrkoPgq0,❤ 🙏😥
292,NKsYrkoPgq0,I love you yes theory but you have to stand with right side
293,NKsYrkoPgq0,You have to have a side . What is happening  right now is a genocide
294,NKsYrkoPgq0,Seek discomfort seek the truth stand with palestine. Don’t be neutral. Be brave and dig for the truth.
295,NKsYrkoPgq0,Free palestine 🇵🇸
296,NKsYrkoPgq0,"You have to do your own research. Don't trust the mainstream media. They are lying to the mass people. If you truly understand the history, then you'll know who's guilty. When you are being oppressed for decades, with your basic human rights being controlled by the the other ""government"", how can it not create a so-called ""terrorist group"". They are not terrorist, they are just freedom fighters. Trying to fight for their right to LIVE FREELY. It is not a war. A war is when both sides are equal in power, etc. Please, do your research."
297,go42FugS4uE,"(Matt wrote this on his newsletter today, but we thought we'd share it here too) 

Hey there, 

Today is a big day for me. 
We're finally revealing the book cover to all of you. I've been waiting for this moment for so long. But it's tough to celebrate. The world is in so much pain right now. 

My heart breaks for those most affected. For the innocents. The moms, dads but especially the kids. On all sides. In times like these when it's all too easy to feel helpless, I remember the Joan Baez quote, “Action is the antidote to despair.” Action doesn't have to be anything big. Action is a smile. A compliment. A call to a friend. Action, sometimes, is simply continuing. 

With 37 days left until the book comes out, I've been hesitant to keep talking about it. There are more important things going on. But when I really sit and think about it, the most impactful thing I can do is share this story—our story—with the world. A story about befriending strangers. A story about following one's bliss. A story about letting go of old narratives. 

So I hope you'll understand if I don't stop. If I keep pushing. I hope you'll also remember that on days of despair, the most important thing you can do is continue in the pursuit of your truth. The world needs it. It needs your light, your smile, your push. Now more than ever. Keep going. 

Love, 

Matt"
298,go42FugS4uE,So proud of y’all!! Can’t wait to read the book!!
299,go42FugS4uE,I'm getting the book for sure
300,go42FugS4uE,I will get all of my friends to buy it lol
301,go42FugS4uE,"Hi there,

I just wanted to give you a heads up that we’re putting a quick pause on promotion of the book due to the events happening in the Middle East.

It feels off to talk about a book this week with everything that’s happening right now.

For that reason, we’re pushing back the launch by two weeks. Talk To Strangers will now release on December 3rd, 2023.

Your book will ship immediately upon launch and you’ll receive a tracking number along with it.

If you no longer want the book because of the date change, I totally understand. Please reach out to our team at email and they’ll get your money back to you right away.

Alright, that’s all for now.

Thank you for your understanding, for your love, and for your continuous support.

Sending love your way,

Matt"
302,go42FugS4uE,are you going to release an audiobook version as well?
303,go42FugS4uE,Everyone needs a Dez in their life haha
304,go42FugS4uE,Dez is one of my favorite ad ons to YES Theory. Her and Stephan. Love it.
305,go42FugS4uE,"I love all of this, and I am so incredibly pumped for the Buried Life episode!!! Loving all of Matt’s Going Away Party."
306,go42FugS4uE,Is Derin credited anywhere for cowriting?
307,go42FugS4uE,"Hi Dez and Matt! I like the color combo however I prefer this time the papercover. All my books have the hard cover but I was thinking to Yes theory book passes the lighter version. To enjoy life, seek discomfort needs some kind of flexibility. In this case easier to read and hopefully to use it in every day life ;) ❤ However the most important thing is that you enjoyed doing this together and Matt achieved his goal what makes him proud 🎉❤. Hugs!😊"
308,go42FugS4uE,Why aren’t you speaking for Israel? You spoke so loudly about Ukraine..
309,go42FugS4uE,this is my favourite podcast by far
310,go42FugS4uE,stoooop i am so so excited to read this and the the fact that Mark Manson gave a review on it and read it ??? like omg “the art of not giving a f” is literally one of my favorite books 🫶🏼💙⚡️⚡️⚡️
311,go42FugS4uE,"Amazing podcast! Thank you for being so vulnerable, love the vibe you two bring!!"
312,go42FugS4uE,❤❤❤
313,go42FugS4uE,"The cover looks sick ! Great color  pallet,  not messy at all ! You guys can be very proud :)"
314,go42FugS4uE,So excited to get my book!
315,go42FugS4uE,"Hey, I´m really excited for the book! Will there be an audio version available? Would love that!"
316,go42FugS4uE,Is it just me that think he could have his own yes theory series that is just these podcasts.. since he seems to love this ?
317,HVVajQO7w0A,"What would you guys tell a 35 yr old guy that has been doing the same thing since he was 18 ... he has dreams of wanting to do more, but his dreams are vague because he's never done anything else."
318,HVVajQO7w0A,Promo>SM ❤️
319,HVVajQO7w0A,"When I turned thirty last year, blew my mind how much I did accomplish! Even prouder of you all ❤ grew up with you guys, I have seek discomfort flags everywhere. I even was asked “ I love that saying where did you get it” by an elderly gentleman off a sweatshirt from last year. I blessed to have found you guys and blessed to pass it on to my children and my community who needs a little happiness. Been apart of yes fam, Kentucky, Indiana Tennessee for awhile and keep trying to build relationships out there! Have a blessed day."
320,HVVajQO7w0A,I love both of them 😍💖
321,HVVajQO7w0A,Theoretically Yess ❤
322,SCH3AmkeKHI,Thanks for this convo Matt and thanks for listening everyone ❤
323,SCH3AmkeKHI,One of the most beautiful conversations I have ever witnessed 🤍💙
324,SCH3AmkeKHI,wooow.. i stopped watching for years because something didnt feel the same.. now i understand thank you
325,SCH3AmkeKHI,"Good for you guys. This is fantastic, especially to see two young men talking so openly about how they feel. Bravo! It’s remarkable the insights that you’re having at 30. I’m 39, and it certainly is a much different perspective than 29, but I’m just starting to finally sit with myself and feel everything I’ve been through over my lifetime. Lots and lots of trauma. Lots of saying yes when I really wanted to say no. Lots of burn out. It is hard and it is a lot to process. But man is life so much better once you do and have that wisdom and experience to pull from. Great video. Thanks for being brave!"
326,SCH3AmkeKHI,❤❤
327,SCH3AmkeKHI,"This was powerful. Thank you for inviting us in to witness the respect, compassion, and love you have for each other. Wow, just amazing. And yes: MAGIC happened in that black taxi when Matt joined."
328,SCH3AmkeKHI,"Wow. Deep. Thanks Thomas and Matt for opening up and being vulnerable in front of the Yes Theory family. Great role models for your audience and men, to be real with yourself and reflect your emotions. The videos are amazing, we don’t realize the amount of pull it may have on a Youtubers life. Thank you guys for all that you do for the global community. Peace be with you and greetings from Los Angeles, you guys rock!"
329,SCH3AmkeKHI,If you do what you have always done you will get what you always had ❤️
330,SCH3AmkeKHI,Thanks to a useful in-depth conversation
331,SCH3AmkeKHI,You guys obviously love each other. I can't imagine either of you not being in each other's lives.
332,SCH3AmkeKHI,"I finally got around to watching this one. My birthday was 11/19 I’m so happy to see what happened on that day and to now come back and here this, it was a surprise gift that was in front of my eyes ❤"
333,SCH3AmkeKHI,Matt had to come back to fix the damage his brother did
334,SCH3AmkeKHI,❤ brave. deep. raw. inspirational. thank you! ❤
335,SCH3AmkeKHI,"Awesome conversation guys, thank you for sharing"
336,SCH3AmkeKHI,Audience to subscribers to community is all telling
337,SCH3AmkeKHI,This was a beautiful conversation
338,SCH3AmkeKHI,"I feel this so much. I was also never really able to admit it out loud, because COVID meant a lot of horrible things for a lot of people. The impact that it had on everyone was severe, so I still don't understand why, but the pandemic really saved my life. That was the only way that I was able to escape from the horrible life that I had, slow down and start working on myself to change it."
339,SCH3AmkeKHI,"Honestly there is nothing more attractive than a man who talks so openly about his intentions, fears and emotions. It makes me quite sad and annoyed at us people for having built, throughout many decades, this type of patriarchal society where sharing these parts of ourselves with this kind of openness is considered weak and something to be ashamed of for men. I truly admire the ability that you two have to sit in front of each other and share your experiences face to face. It takes a lot of emotional intelligence, and I am glad to see it happening more and more between guys.💫"
340,SCH3AmkeKHI,"I can so relate to Matt a little bit right now, as I’ve had a pretty adventurous life up until the last year or so and at this point, I’m 34 and I have no idea what I want in life. I just want to be happy, I know that much."
341,SCH3AmkeKHI,There is just something about Matt that is icky. The way he moves there is something about him. Even more so the fact that he left abruptly did his own thing using the fame of yes theory then came back when it was time to promote his book. I know he went through a lot and I get it. But you can go through a lot and still be a little bit of an egotistical arrogant person. Anyways glad they’re talking though 😊
342,LmZy0EG70R4,"These podcasts have been helping me through a difficult time. Thank you SO MUCH for making these and speaking truth about your experiences. I came back into my body slowly from April-August of last year and am finding ways to stay. Inner child practices, yoga, breathwork, somatic movement and time outside have really helped me. I’m beginning to see the people and situations that are currently in my life that I need space from. It’s kind of a scary time because I used to define myself from external sources. Now I know my worth and my value and am meant for so much more. I’m becoming a trauma informed breathwork practitioner and I want to help others find safe space for themselves. As I’m moving through my own difficulties, I know I’m not alone and this community is a safe space for me. So thank you again from the bottom of my heart. 💛"
343,LmZy0EG70R4,"Mattttttttt,

It’s been so cool watching these but EVEN more amazing seeing how happy you are. You are so awesome and deserve every good thing."
344,LmZy0EG70R4,❤
345,LmZy0EG70R4,"a lot of people dont know what Bonnie explained about therapy, it is such a complex world and finding a connection with a specific therapist is soo necesary"
346,LmZy0EG70R4,Bonnie is priceless. Love this girl! Thanks for representing us fellow therapists.
347,LmZy0EG70R4,This was so insightful I had to reflect on my life and reconsider seeing a therapist. Thank you guys so much for the great conversation. This will help a lot of people to have a better view of their lives and change. ❤
348,LmZy0EG70R4,Matt you are killing it with the podcasts!
349,LmZy0EG70R4,Holy shit I related with this so much
350,LmZy0EG70R4,"The moment you guys mentioned the sentence ""I do not deserve to be happy"" I cried like a baby in the car non stop for the whole trip. Something just snapped and I was aware i was putting on a lot of suffering on myself as well ever since my mom passed. I kept things bottled up for 7 years i felt like drowning.

After that I needed help so i reached out to my good friend/business partner about it. The moment i told him what i heard and triggered me ""I do not deserve to be happy"". The flood gates was open again for a good 5-10 minutes before i could have a proper conversation with him. Felt pretty good about it as he assured me he got my back. But in the end i think i need to see help with a therapist.

I also agree with bonnie about the topic of mental health it being like a taboo in asia. I hate the term ""real men don't cry they bleed"". I know this programming is not helpful at all as it has served me through my childhood. So it's hard for me to be vulnerable and open up to people up till this day as I'm always afraid that people will leave when they know how broken I am and I will not be loved. That was my biggest fear.

Thanks for sharing this episode, your journey, struggles and for breaking part of the the wall that i have been building for 7 years."
351,LmZy0EG70R4,Banafshehhhhh😍
352,LmZy0EG70R4,"You mixing soooo much photos and videos together... Talking about Palace and showing hotels, mosques and other stuff... Yeah it's all super fancy k know... But the videos barely Match your Skript...

You completely distorting the whole story... lots of wrong informations!"
353,LmZy0EG70R4,“You train people how to treat you”….  🤯 Man I wish Bonnie had a Patreon. I’d pay for that
354,LmZy0EG70R4,"You expressing your vulnerability of what it feels like to be a human in todays world, is so needed right now, to go even further has been a need for decades. Your bravery is amazing, Matt!

With that, I love to hear the action behind it in regards to getting people access to free mental health care so they don’t have to feel like they’re alone and or can get help to rethink their current struggles. 

There are millions of people that unfortunately don’t have the luxury to find a “big sister” therapist. I’m not saying that to make you feel bad or to shame in anyway. It’s just a hard truth or reality. With that, you also can’t save the entire world, but you sharing this, helps SO MANY! 

Beautiful episode. 💝 THANK YOU both and additionally, Derin, and the Yes Theory team."
355,LmZy0EG70R4,I learned so much from this episode. I’m team “never been to a therapist” and this was invaluable knowledge. Thank you so much
356,LmZy0EG70R4,"I totally agree on taking a year out to explore without plans, you never know what it might lead to.When I was 19 i was very depressed and my friend called me to meet him in Chiang Mai Thailand he was studing in Bejing and it changed the course of my life. I ended up spending a year there then went on to work as a nanny in Holland, Mexico, Chile and Spain. I'm now 33 and work as an English teacher in Barcelona. Life is too short to not have great adventures :)"
357,LmZy0EG70R4,Love Bonnie already  from this 😊❤
358,LmZy0EG70R4,Loved it ❤❤❤😊
359,LmZy0EG70R4,I think it’s amazing that some of us can realize when we are mentally struggling with a lot and don’t want to really hurt anyone else in the process. My father violated me at a really young age and it really affected me as a person. Once my kiddos kind of grew up I seeked professional help for everything I’ve been through. Your personal mental space is important and I hope more people learn to feel comfortable there. Because only there are we able to help others and join together and make this world a better place
360,LmZy0EG70R4,There is something so compelling about Matt's voice and his delivery: he could be delivering a weather forecast -- even a sunny California forecast -- and have me crying in about five minutes.
361,LmZy0EG70R4,Thank you sooo much for this ❤ You have no idea how much I need to keep hearing this message. I’m currently in my rest year from burn out and it has been the biggest blessing. I hope we all come to be more in tune with our minds and bodies so we can lead more joyful and happier lives!
362,k73q9C2o6R8,His Brother damaged the theory And maty nad to come back especialy after the incydent in Japan
363,k73q9C2o6R8,"wow. this podcast has me in tears. I feel as if I'm in a similar situation to you Matt, as I'm preparing myself to take the next big step in my life and it has me scared as hell. Truly. But this conversation reminded me how it is all just a part of the process of growth, self-love, and self-realization. I have taken many steps before, and I will continue to keep walking after this big step. thank you Matt & Pedro for being so open and for sharing your wisdom with us. You are a huge inspiration to me Matt and I'm so excited to read your story. Sending you much love from Pennsylvania. 

Sincerely, 
-Matt Peel"
364,k73q9C2o6R8,"The light metaphor as you progress through life is deep, yet a powerful message."
365,k73q9C2o6R8,"I've known of Yes Theory from beginning of project 30 when it was still below 5k subs 🎉 can't remember the exact figure but somewhere in the 2,000s I think"
366,k73q9C2o6R8,"Wow, what an incredible episode. Pedro is truly amazing. Vai Brasil <3"
367,k73q9C2o6R8,Wise and clever guy that Pedro. Really nice guys thank you!! ❤️❤️
368,k73q9C2o6R8,Pedro traz esses meninos pra se aventurarem pelo Brasiiiiilllllll 🇧🇷
369,k73q9C2o6R8,"This message could not have come at a better time. I am getting ready to get out of the military to pursue a life that is aligned with my most authentic self. And it quite literally feels like a jump in the dark. Freedom seems like the antithesis of security, and those fears of the unknown creep in no matter how much I try to focus on my excitement. It is so helpful to think that I am bringing all those tools with me from the path of light I have been following.  Though I feel like I am jumping into the deep end, I can find comfort in the fact that this path already taught me how to swim. Thank you so much. Cheers!"
370,k73q9C2o6R8,"Any last words of wisdom!? Holy crow, everything the man said was insight after insight, prompting so many perspective shifts I couldn't even keep up! I gotta let all of this sift through my brain. Thank you so much for this conversation."
371,k73q9C2o6R8,Truly an incredible episode. Absolutely loved it and was exactly what I needed to hear. So so amazing to hear from Pedro & so inspired by him!! And by Matt of course! Change is so hard and I’m so proud of him. We all are 🫶🏼
372,k73q9C2o6R8,What a fantastic conversation! Happy to get to know Pedro too :)
373,k73q9C2o6R8,Cisv did exactly the same for me! Love to see fellow cisvers spreading positivity
374,k73q9C2o6R8,So excited I finally could order this book and I loved hearing the story behind writing it. Amazing!
375,k73q9C2o6R8,"I’m planning on riding my longboard from Regina to Vancouver next summer. I was thinking of making it like a terry fox run for a regenerative land project that I’m working on with my mom. I was also thinking of trying to get a sponsor for it but I don’t know what my best way to go about that would be, and when it would be best to start looking for said sponsor. I was hoping (but not relying) that you might have some words of wisdom that might better guide me."
376,k73q9C2o6R8,"Am I the only one having issues with pre-ordering the book? I tried different payment methods but nothing worked. Is this a known problem or is it just a fault on my side? I appreciate any help I can get, thank you <3 Loved the Episode like always!!"
377,k73q9C2o6R8,"Love this pod cast. Head of operations is a  really wise person. 15 hours a day is too hard for anyone.  Do yous need another trustworthy someone to help take some of the load off the head of operations. Health and balance  is so important.
 The book "" Feel the fear and do it anyway"" reminds the need to fill our cup and map out a life grid of 9 areas. Then when something happens we have the other areas of life to back us up and our well being can be stronger and resilient. I forget to do this but your podcast reminded me to reread it. Creating a better livable life that we love. Thankyou  both of you.😇🙏"
378,k73q9C2o6R8,What a legend! Sound sounds like such a smart & well spoken guy! Really cool meeting Pedro!!
379,k73q9C2o6R8,I think Pedro’s name should be in the title. This is an amazing conversation
380,k73q9C2o6R8,Wow... It was a really great episode... I think I need a Pedro or/and a Matt :)  I will watch it again to encourage me to do things but also to figure out how to change things.  Wow !
381,k73q9C2o6R8,This is a fascinating and mind-blowing episode. It's nice to hear more about the behind-the-scenes of Yes Theory.
382,5dh-jjo9lqw,Honored to be a part of this process with you Matt. Excited to see what the next chapter holds in store for you!
383,5dh-jjo9lqw,Matt's going away poddy is amazing. I love being able to watch this journey :'). Thank you for sharing.
384,5dh-jjo9lqw,"I’m sorry but Matt has a gf? Damn, lucky gal, lucky guy"
385,5dh-jjo9lqw,"Matt, you're awsome with the "" Interviews"" ( I dont know if we can say that, cos it's more a good chat). You could interview a lot more people.... *hint* *hint* *hint"" 😄"
386,5dh-jjo9lqw,Why isn’t this being posted to the main feed?! I totally missed this and Matt deserve to be on the feed!
387,5dh-jjo9lqw,"Similar to Will Smith's book, I think 'Talking to Strangers' also deserves a solid audiobook version in Matt's voice, with some edits from the Yes Theory Team. That would be incredible!!"
388,5dh-jjo9lqw,Newsletter link ain’t working
389,5dh-jjo9lqw,"Really enjoying these pods. It's nice to sit and chill and listen and learn :) I can relate to a lot of what you both talk about here! Recently quit my job, searching for purpose and what is important to me now. I'm learning to not put so much pressure on myself. Self-compassion is huge!"
390,5dh-jjo9lqw,"Compliments to Matt on being such a great listener! Trying to work on my listening skills and making people feel heard, and Matt you really set a good example!!"
391,5dh-jjo9lqw,This was great! 👍
392,5dh-jjo9lqw,"Fantastic conversation. Couldn’t agree more that there is so much free information & tools for people to create the change they desire, yet… they’ll find anything & anyone to blame for their inaction. 😅 Easier than getting up & taking action. Thank you Matt, thank you Mark. Looking forward to other conversations! 😊"
393,5dh-jjo9lqw,Please restock the pre-order of the book in EU! Looking so much forward to it!❤❤
394,5dh-jjo9lqw,Im excited to watch some of Mark’s videos now!! 🙌🏼
395,5dh-jjo9lqw,Love the pod. Should make it longer. Could easily be 2+ hours
396,5dh-jjo9lqw,❤ its so good to see you again Matt
397,5dh-jjo9lqw,"This resonated with me a lot. I am in the middle of writing my PhD thesis at the moment and there are many similarities to writing a book. Imposter syndrome is real sometimes. I also liked the bit about how anxiety never really goes away, you just learn how to deal with it better by exposing yourself to situations and keeping your goal in mind. Humour is so important and also having a network of people around you for support. I'm looking forward to the next episode Matt, keep up the good work!"
398,5dh-jjo9lqw,As someone who is going through a hard transition myself it is reassuring to know I'm not alone. Cannot wait to read your book and i am looking forward to your next episode 🙂🙂
399,5dh-jjo9lqw,Great episode & conversation!! Can’t wait for the rest and the book!
400,5dh-jjo9lqw,"Great episode, it means so much to see how open both of you are talking about all the emotions, struggles, and mindset shifts throughout both your journeys."
401,5dh-jjo9lqw,"Great session, guys!🎉Thanks!❤"

Here are the links that are mentioned in this episode.

Hope you enjoyed the episode!"
403,acP5ANnM1fo,The problem is that you’re fake and you want to look perfect in your videos “the wise group” sort of thing but the reality is that y’all just normal people you don’t need to be a representation of perfect you only need keep doing the genuine content no one cares if you love or hate each other at the end of day seek discomfort ffs
404,acP5ANnM1fo,Thank you so much for sharing your story! ❤️
405,acP5ANnM1fo,Someone wanna explain why he left?
406,acP5ANnM1fo,"I dont get it the way he is making it sound is as if he was secretly miserable the whole time with Yes Theory, and that its not who he truly is and he can finally shed the mask. What so bad about it? Makes me think about old videos and  like second guess if Matt was really enjoying himself and being authentic. Idk its just weird watching all those videos over the years with all the motivational speeches and see Matt work so hard and carry a certain message and then now hearing him say he couldn’t wait to get away from it.."
407,acP5ANnM1fo,"Words cannot describe my respect for Matt's devotion to self-reflection, to vulnerability, and to his drive to really know, and be comfortable with himself. It's been a gift to bear witness to this journey from afar, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that it's led me to seriously contemplate the current trajectory of my life and what I'm doing here in the first place. 
To this community, thank you. A million times over, thank you. It's been so heartening to witness it grow into what it is, and what it stands for. I wish everyone here nothing but the best, as we continue to navigate this convoluted miracle that we call life."
408,acP5ANnM1fo,Matt ❤
409,acP5ANnM1fo,"Parachuting in to promote your book, huh?"
410,acP5ANnM1fo,"Unpopular opinion, I’m sure this will be, but all of this seems self-indulgent and overly dramatic. Also feels like it’s being milked… if you want to understand what’s going on you go to this video which tells you to go to that video which tells you to go to this newsletter all of which tells you over and over again about the book. For someone who apparently wants to be on his own and normal he seems to desperately crave attention. I’m sorry. I’m normally not a hater but I just… this just all seems so disingenuous to me. And the breakdown of the friendships makes me wonder if I’m right. Anyway, I do wish him and everyone well. Just seems like a lot of millennial stuff."
411,acP5ANnM1fo,"Running towards ourselves begins today.

When we've constantly been moving, there is the fear that upon coming to a stop, we find that we still haven't found a direction, or that the direction we've been heading down no longer serves us. It is one of the scariest things to embrace. But it's in the stillness where the voice we've been listening for finally has the opportunity to speak to us; ignore that voice for too long, build up too many walls around it, and one day, it'll feel like the world that we've constructed gets torn down. From that destruction of the obstructions that no longer serve us and in clearing the debris, we get the opportunity to enter a new chapter, one more closely aligned with our True Nature. Just as suffering is a choice but pain is inevitable, so too is the inevitability of this process. The sooner we lean into ourselves, the sooner we transmute our pains into discomforts, into acceptance, into Wisdom and Love. 

""For a seed to achieve its greatest expression, it must come completely undone. The shell cracks, its insides come out and everything changes. To someone who doesn't understand growth, it would look like complete destruction.""

412,acP5ANnM1fo,"Welcome back Matt! The book chapter is very interesting.. One woul''ve think looking back or reflecting through your experiences that it would uplift you, reminisce the good times with yes theory and all the challenges but instead you mentioned the feeling of being ""not part of this group"" or ""not connecting to the audience"" which is unfathomable 

but at the montreal chapter with Derin and after that - this is actually where the reminiscing happened.  Sometimes the good ol times are the best times where it's not meant to be replaced by something better but it's so good it's meant to be treasured forever"
413,acP5ANnM1fo,Missed you 😊 happy to see you 💙
414,acP5ANnM1fo,"Matt that was powerful, we love to have you back. As a Montréaler, you're right, it's such a wonderful place💚 Thanks for sharing."
415,acP5ANnM1fo,"Dear Matt, thank you so much for your fully authetic & vulnerable soultalk and to bring us into your personal story, into the roots and energy source of Yes Theorie. Can't wait to read the book :) Enjoy your going away party"
416,acP5ANnM1fo,awesome; just everything <3 thank you
417,acP5ANnM1fo,So what's he doing in TLDR? Coming back on videos or saying good by to yes theory forever?
418,acP5ANnM1fo,"I think this is more of a ""graduating"" than ""quitting."" That's why it has to be celebrated and I would argue that Matt is easily on the Yes Theory Hall of Fame."
419,acP5ANnM1fo,"Matt, Yes Theory, the community.  Thank you all for being amazing.  The tears, laughs and smiles this channel has brought me over the years is hard to put into words.  From the game to the book I preordered them all.  Love you all!"
420,acP5ANnM1fo,Montreal Baby!!
421,acP5ANnM1fo,"Cool video Matt, i always liked your video's the most so i'm glad we get to see you more for now and goodluck on whats next."
422,X-l0ltZYXe4,I'm trying these things because even the medicine prescribed to me to slow down my intestines is not helping with my gut issues.
423,X-l0ltZYXe4,"I have ADHD wich is known for gut issues. There is some reasons why that is. 1. We are dopamine seekers wich meens we go for carbs and sugars, 2. Chewing takes fokus wich we don't always have. 3. We forget to eat or push it to the last second wich makes us hungry when we eat and hunger makes us eat faster. When you are aware of that, you can try find a way to organize around it so that short here is a very good advise."
424,X-l0ltZYXe4,Chewing 30 times???!!!????! How tf
425,X-l0ltZYXe4,Stop drinking coffee.
426,zj-tIolzoz8,That’s cap
427,zj-tIolzoz8,First
428,w8HiNmhI6Zs,Was coffee for me
429,w8HiNmhI6Zs,"I did the same with beer, only took a few, and then I liked it!"
430,w8HiNmhI6Zs,Obviously none of these people have children
431,w8HiNmhI6Zs,I actually do this for my kids lol
432,JNXVCqm4FC4,"""Nutrition Experts"" is this a joke ? Since when individuals with a naturopathy background are nutrition experts ? Many claims made during this podcast with zero to weak evidence at best. In other words naturopathic ""doctors"" base their claims on pseudoscientific evidence, which is not to be taken seriously. If you want nutrition experts reach out to registered dieticians or someone with a masters degree in nutrition science."
433,JNXVCqm4FC4,How am I just now seeing the podcast? I’ve been following you all for like 6 years lol
434,JNXVCqm4FC4,"Did that guest seriously describe his mother getting cancer as serendipitous? Mate, this is why we should not use words we don’t know 💀 it was extremely uncomfortable to hear"
435,JNXVCqm4FC4,"This episode has really resonated with me. Yes Theory is the reason that for the first time in my life, I've taken control of my eating habits.

My mom didn't cook for me growing up for a variety of reasons, and when we did have proper meals, it was really just eating fast food or boxed Macaroni. It's ironic because when I was really young, she basically forbid sugar. No candies, pastries, any of that. My grandma exposed us (secretly) to doughnuts, and we started asking my mom for sugar. So, while I did grow up not eating healthy, my mom wasn't openly stocking the house with junk food either.

At 16, I got my license and started buying a little bit of my own food. I bought all kinds of sugary things; I tried my first Debbie rolls and ate horrible cereals and sodas, etc. I had been depraved of sugar my whole life, and being the depressed ADHD teen I was, I got a huge hit of dopamine from sugar. It's literally up until the last 2 months that I finally said NO MORE !!!

I'd become increasingly aware of how exhausted and unwell I felt, particularly after a fast food meal. I'd get SO tired. It felt like I had just run a marathon, but without the pride and dopamine that brings. So, I connected the dots and recognized the problem. Since then, I've been pre-cooking all my meals at home and reheating them when I'm ready.

I allow myself to still eat things I like (such as chocolate pancakes) but pair it with other foods of nutritional value. It's literally changed my life, I feel much more energized after these meals and knowing exactly what is in my food, and how it's being made, has had such a strong impact on me. I didn't realize just how much it could mean to connect with the food I eat.

I'm no stranger to both ends of eating disorders, and I literally WAS the kid you mentioned who would eat whole tubs of Nutella as a kid (it once landed me in the hospital for how sick I got).

I've really pulled myself out of my eating disorders since I became an adult, and especially the last two months, but when people asked me how, I never had an answer. It just kind of ... happened? But this episode has made me realize it didn't just suddenly fix itself. It was the exposure to food culture within my Japanese language class in 9th grade!

It was the first time I ever learned about another country fully, and they really value food in Japan. I was so inspired that I got a sushi making kit and have been making sushi since. It's an art form. You don't just eat the sushi. You appreciate the work from every angle; the farmers, the sellers, the chefs, and the servers. 

いただきむす。That is what I think to myself at the beginning of every meal I make. And once I'm replenished, ごちそうさまでした。

Thank you for helping me with such an important part of being human. Thank you for guiding me to the realization of how I overcame eating disorders. It's been such a mystery, and now I feel I can help my friends better by guiding them to a more mindful headspace when it comes to food."
436,JNXVCqm4FC4,"One should respect things like the creation of Pencillin that was one of the most important contributors to elongating our lifespan. I also understand that there are many acute cases where you have to take antibiotics to save yourself. I have great respect for medical professionals saving people's lives. At the same time I can't appreciate what the modern health care has become. First the food industry produces highly processed products, such as candy, sugary drinks, fast food etc. that are causing many health problems. Then there's tons of pills being sold as a solution. The most tragic part here is that many people keep buying the pills because they don't know any better. This is why conversations like this one are so important!"
437,JNXVCqm4FC4,Why dont these podcasts have more views????☹☹☹  When is the next one?
438,JNXVCqm4FC4,"I went to a girls boarding high school, and I remember our Home Science teacher once standing in the Dining Hall telling us to chew our food 32 times before swallowing. It was a good high school and we got high grades, and because of that, we were sort of always in a rush during food times.  And they would lock the doors to the DH, have everyone seated down at their tables, then a prayer would be said to bless the food, and the food would be served on individual plates on the table. And the DH doors would be locked for 15mins or so. Nobody could walkout.   And I know realize they did so so that we could eat our food slowly. Coz immediately they would open the doors, there would be a mad dash out of the DH."
439,JNXVCqm4FC4,"When will you come back, guys"
440,JNXVCqm4FC4,Such an important discussion you guys needs to do something that can touch a bigger audience with these information!
441,JNXVCqm4FC4,I noticed ; USA eats individually ; other county's eat village FAMILY .  this would effect all you eat consistency.   from this pod.....!👉first video Thomas did not use the F-word !...
442,JNXVCqm4FC4,"Since everyone from Yes Theory is living in different places now, was this shot in the past?"
443,JNXVCqm4FC4,Loved the full podcast!
444,JNXVCqm4FC4,Are you no longer on Spotify?
445,JNXVCqm4FC4,Amazing insights! This will help me so much- I have a list of health notes on food and habits now :)
446,JNXVCqm4FC4,When was this recorded?
447,JNXVCqm4FC4,Wow what a great episode I definitely going to dive deep in to this stuff …. I’ve been trying to find the right information for so long thank you guys
448,JNXVCqm4FC4,can you make a BOYS ONLY type of episode every now and then ofc with mat
449,JNXVCqm4FC4,loved the episode
450,JNXVCqm4FC4,So excited about this episode and  naturopathic medicine being talked about by our professional colleagues Dr. Sam and Dr. G with my favorite Yes Theory guys! - great point 👉 need to feel good (good health) to live a great life.
451,JNXVCqm4FC4,you guys are the best
452,Zzq3QssOyOg,Gulligt 😁
453,Zzq3QssOyOg,how adorable is that!
454,Zzq3QssOyOg,Until a black guy spoke Swedish then u were like whaaaah?🤨
455,Zzq3QssOyOg,Lol
456,Zzq3QssOyOg,Thats how it should be
457,Zzq3QssOyOg,I wish that’s how it was but we have creeps to worry about
458,Zzq3QssOyOg,He has good memory
459,Zzq3QssOyOg,Adorable
460,Zzq3QssOyOg,"This is what Jesus talks about when he says having the mind of a child... Everybody  is welcomed automatically just because, and no hate just positivity"
461,Zzq3QssOyOg,Jag dör lmao🤣
462,Zzq3QssOyOg,"I think it’s weird how on popular videos, you look at the comments and they have only a hundred something comments (for example, 13)"
463,Zzq3QssOyOg,Host: 😐 this story is really boring
464,Zzq3QssOyOg,White stories are so dull and not funny
465,Zzq3QssOyOg,early
466,Zzq3QssOyOg,Woah crazy ass story bruh ig everyone CAN do podcasts😳🤣

474,zFSu_VLWnwU,Oh this is a good one 👀
475,zFSu_VLWnwU,"I have ADHD and dyslexia and didn't know I had either most of my life and none of my childhood. Not one single teacher, administrator, therapist nothing ever brought that up as maybe the root of my problems and all of my symptoms were basically textbook ADHD and dyslexia and no one thought maybe this is what you're experiencing. Teachers would actually say to my mom that when I want to learn I will, as an explanation for my bad grades instead of them just being piece of shit teachers! And this was the 90s in california, not a time frame before ADHD and dyslexia were known"
476,zFSu_VLWnwU,Interesting time I've never heard of that! Being able to understand the language but you can't speak it. I don't even get how that's possible
477,zFSu_VLWnwU,"this was super interesting thanks! i actually asked myself the same questions you were aksing eachother during this conversation!:) i have a multicultural background too: born in france but moved to Scotland when i was only 15 days old, spent 6 years there, then 4 years in Ireland, and both my parents were also born and raised in foreign countries different than mine. 
I think the only people i truely identify too are those who also have this kind of multicultural background, we always kindda get eachother! not having one specific identity and background, or one place we really consider as ""home""
Home and identity are really those place we just feel good and choose for our selfs with time, especially when we dont fit into the ""usual"" boxes society makes for us
and i think we also manage to identity alot to other yes fam members because alot of us have multiple backgrounds or the will to travel and become citizens of the world!
big shoutout to all of the other multicultural people who are out there and those who are creating identities they feel more deeply connected too <3"
478,zFSu_VLWnwU,You can live in your own country and still feel like an outsider. I lived in my home country for 40 years before moving to the US and feel more at home here than I ever felt there. The freedom that you have as an adult in the US to be whoever you want to be is extremely valuable.
479,zFSu_VLWnwU,"As a white American that was born and raised in the USA, my ethnicity is extremely European diverse like English, Scottish, Swedish, etc. However, many Americans like myself have never visited these countries where our ancestors and many generations of the family lineage spent most of their time living before coming to America. Many Americans say things like “I’m Irish” but we don’t really know what being that identity is like because we live in America. Something I thought would be an interesting point of view to provide regarding identity.

These 3 guys have been to their home and native lands but many Americans have not."
480,zFSu_VLWnwU,"I know this doesn't relate to cultural differences, but I felt extremely alienated as a child with severe ADHD in the forms of executive paralysis and time blindness. I felt like a foreigner to everyone else. Even around the other ADHD kids because to me they seemed normal. They could brush their teeth, eat their food, etc. without it feeling like it was a million steps to accomplish this huge overarching goal that was just in the way of everything else I always had to think about doing. You guys have influenced me so much over the past 3 years. I have gotten properly diagnosed as an adult with ADHD (I know that doesn't sound like much but ask someone with severe ADHD how long it took them. It took me 4 years after having the first intention of doing so). I've gone skydiving, I've done random challenges with strangers and made a few cool friends. I've branched out into new areas of self expression in general.

As a 30 year old leaving his nice childhood life back in Texas to pursue a career here in Minnesota for the past 5 years. I cannot thank you guys enough. I can feel like this is home now and I'm proud of that. Thankfully, being a software engineer by trade REALLY suits an ADHD brain in the transition to a new space lol. Otherwise, I would have been F***ED"
481,zFSu_VLWnwU,"Growing up in a Norwegian household in California, I also could understand Norwegian fluently, but I couldn't for the life of me speak it (or write it). I also wonder if I was made fun of and that just made me stop wanting to speak the language. Apparently before preschool I mostly spoke Norwegian at home, but once I started going to school, I quickly stopped speaking it."
482,zFSu_VLWnwU,"this is so interesting! i am a chinese-born canadian-naturalized young man. i lived 7 years in china, 11 in canada, 10 in america, and now im living in france. I speak english french and chinese. while i find it to be a tremendous blessing to have experienced so much of the world, i have a worry that the more cultures and cities i experience, the harder and harder it will become for me to choose a place to settle down in. since i'll have seen the best of many cultures."
483,zFSu_VLWnwU,Identidy is a process... i mean it  changes over time...
484,zFSu_VLWnwU,I Don't think you guys will see this but I have journey that will change your view on special needs kids for life would be a great documentary
485,zFSu_VLWnwU,Just found this channel
486,zFSu_VLWnwU,"23:56 I think we are in this age where we have a lot more luxuries which allow us time to think deeper about ...everything. This can definitely be negative - I think it has a lot to do with modern anxiety and depression etc. But I think that wanting a cultural identity and wanting to fit in has evolved as time goes on, but that it fundamentally originates from evolution - and needing to feel a part of something, identifying with something. Because humans are stronger in packs, and being (and STAYING) a part of a group heavily increases chances of survival. So those who felt a belonging to their tribe, stayed together and thus people will that feeling of identity and togetherness survived more."
487,zFSu_VLWnwU,"This podcast episode was one that really hit close to home. I am a TCK. I am half Australian (white) and half Malaysian (Chinese and Indian). I grew up living in Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia going to international schools with people from all over the world; and then had to move to australia for my last years of highschool (and I’m still here going to university). I don’t speak bahasa or cantonese. I only fluently speak English. I feel Australian in the sense that it’s a place that represents my western side of ideologies and on a language level I fit in and most of my family are here etc, but I don’t feel at home here, and on an identity level I gravitate towards immigrants when it comes to interactions. I didn’t grow up here, I don’t have the same childhood and teen experiences to relate to locals with, I dont have a childhood friendship group or even a highschool one. I am studying International Relations and I love what I study because it encompasses so much of my first hand lived experience. But having moved so much growing up, and now not having an idea of the next time I’ll move countries is extremely daunting. The idea that a place which I have felt the least sense of belonging (despite nationality, language, ideologies and family ties) will overtake the other places I’ve lived as the place I’ve lived longest is scary. It’s almost like to feel a sense of belonging I need to be in a place which is foreign to me because that is my identity. I am a citizen of the world, not to one place."
488,zFSu_VLWnwU,"Very interesting conversation. I was born and raised in the same country, and I never found myself completely related to a specific identity. I'm from Mexico, an I have lived my whole life in a city just on the border between Mexico and the US, and that gives me a lot of influence from both countries. All that I know is that I'm what I want to be right now, and I'm sure that tomorrow I'll going to be a different person, so to me, my identity is changing over time.  LOVE ❤YES FAM!"
489,zFSu_VLWnwU,"Waiting for the ""johnny Harris"" podcast"
490,zFSu_VLWnwU,an amazing conversation
491,zFSu_VLWnwU,"22:50 yea the way I understood it is that identity provides a value framework that ultimately gives you purposes when you're grounded by it bc you feel content
55:50 great point that you capture identity through story telling
58:40 some people would regard to the thing that allowed them to get to these places is god which is interesting
1:01:10 and this is why authenticity is powerful in being a creator
1:25:38 and this is ultimately what brings you meaning in life"

511,Z3QPxq1pt30,"Ok.  Hope you put a ring on her hand.  Shes a keeper.  

Can listen to her speak.  You need more of her. On channel"
512,Z3QPxq1pt30,"i respect ammar so much, but i hope he will stop making excuses for what his father did to him. there is no modern day justification for cutting ties with a child for his/her career choice, especially one with such positive global impact."
513,Z3QPxq1pt30,I need more of this
514,Z3QPxq1pt30,I'm loving this young lady; she's comes across as tuned in :)
515,Z3QPxq1pt30,"What really touched me was the role of her dad (and her family) in this entire journey.   Dads are very important in a child development and their success in life.   We've seen Thomas and his dad, and have heard about his mom in the dyslexia episode.  And then Ammar and his dad. And the more I here how people talk about their parents the more  I get to understand the book by Malcolm Gladwell - The Outliers."
516,Z3QPxq1pt30,It’s so nice to see two young successful Arabs on YouTube sharing their story! :)
517,Z3QPxq1pt30,"When she says that the thing she fears the most happened, so now she's more fearless, I relate so so much. After losing my mom, nothing will ever hurt as much. It feels like with everything I do, I have less to lose, because she's gone."
518,Z3QPxq1pt30,her living room or idk what room it may be but its beautiful. that couch looks so damn comfortable lol.
519,Z3QPxq1pt30,Is anyone able to translate what they were saying at the end of the video when Ammar began to cry?
520,Z3QPxq1pt30,"this is the greatest conversation i've ever had the privilege to listen to, it felt like i was right there with you. when two incredible people who have done so many amazing things in their lives come together and talk earnestly and deeply about things it just creates this magic. i feel blessed to have listened to this conversation. people like you guys make me want to strive to reach the same level, to continue to evolve and grow as a person. thank you for this!!!"
521,Z3QPxq1pt30,"I took my time with this. If felt like we were invited to an intimate conversation and it was done perfectly. 

I want to watch Nelly's story. She will move mountains. 

Oh, and Nelly is one of the most beautiful souls I've ever seen."
522,4GmIKCBnS2c,Well said buddy
523,4GmIKCBnS2c,Lotta info in small space...!!!🧨
524,4GmIKCBnS2c,Has anyone noticed Thomas looks like Ryan gosling
525,4GmIKCBnS2c,This thing make sense
526,4GmIKCBnS2c,Do not let their cuteness fool you. They are in fact very wise
527,4GmIKCBnS2c,Very true!
528,VAwLPpYyYbE,Thanks for posting this guys! Amar ... I'm right with you bro ... your not alone.
529,VAwLPpYyYbE,Oh my word ask him to send his wealthy or transfer all his money to my account. I need that happiness.
530,VAwLPpYyYbE,I think you maybe slightly bi-polar
531,VAwLPpYyYbE,I don't think feeling undeserving has to mean you are addicted to unhappiness.   Hope Amar finds out how to realize he's worthy.
532,VAwLPpYyYbE,Yup...subversion...
533,VAwLPpYyYbE,Awww yea y’all get it. We scared to be awesome?!?!
534,VAwLPpYyYbE,"Thank you Ammar. I resonate with you hard-core. I oftenly am told I have a big heart, but struggle to step into the lighter side of things because of living in dark for much of my younger years."
535,VAwLPpYyYbE,Loved this conversation.
536,VAwLPpYyYbE,"Appreciate how open you guys are about the personal growth process. Great, tough question. Thanks for sharing!"
537,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,Great podcast 😊
538,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,"For me, the process of change started with forgiveness. Forgiving the ones who did me wrong but more so, Forgiving myself for what I did and also for what was done to me. And covid helped by taking me to the depth of depression so I couldn't possibly continue neglecting my state of mind. When you forgive yourself, which is itself a long and painful process,  then the process of taking care of yourself makes sense because now you are worthy of self-love. You are worthy of care. And then you naturally start giving it to others, too."
539,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,"you are both so hard on yourselves omg :(((( its a pandemic for crying out loud. things are HARD, it is unrealistic to expect yourselves to improve with all this extra ""time"""
540,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,❤️ Thank You so much 🙏
541,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,"Gosh. At times I wonder if  Thomas is actually  a psychologist - a therapist extraordinaire. 😉😉😉😉 But really, I wonder if Yes Theory members would take personality tests - like the DICS or MBTI.   It would really be fun to then understand why they struggle differently. And that Covid forced people into using their Inferior functions, thus getting into grip stress.  Extroverts like Ammar, for example, who thrive on connecting with people,  really hard it tough...."
542,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,"This video helped me out so much you have no idea. I feel I can relate to both of you so much, I’m such a deep thinker and it hurts sometimes. I have watched you guys for years and you are my favorite content creators by a long shot. I want to thank you for every single little thing you have done to make us people better. It genuinely means the world to me and i respect and love you guys so much for that. I wish I could have friends like you guys that are also deep thinkers and only want the best for others. I love you guys I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I would love to meet you guys!"
543,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,Powerful conversation. Thank you for sharing. I felt so similar to what both Thomas and Ammar were saying. Much love❤
544,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,"Covid times were harsh it put a hold in my life as well..  maybe it is time to be more with ourselves ... i am on Ammar's page, maybe some of us avoid for so much time being with ourselves, and the relationship with the inner part is like below the ""to do list"""
545,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,Wow guys this entire episode was so therapeutic for me. I really needed all of that advice for myself. I feel inspired by this and I’m really looking forward to hearing more
546,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,"Ammar: I can see how much energy Matt and Thomas have invested in you for years. They are not responsible to lift you up each time. Ammar, you are exhausting yourself with all the internal dialog in your head. Everything in nature must adapt to survive. You are being lazy and running away from healthier decision you can make. Be aware of having more balance."
547,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,I was just talking to my best friend we just started are own business and honestly since it’s it started I’ve been been over thinking every overthinking my entire being I’m still trying to figure it out
548,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,These books by Gary John Bishop really helped me deal with the issues you guys discussed from the book ( unf*ck yourself )to the book (wise as f*ck )
549,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,The goat’s
550,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,"Facing internal discomfort is tough but I guess that's the journey of life 🤷🏽‍♀️- the conflict between set personal goals, what it takes to actually get there, and feeling like there is constantly some sort of deadline to beat..."
551,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,Thomas is an old wise man trapped in a 20 year old body!
552,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,"I think Amar, just like a lot of us at times, needs to get into a beat up session with ourselves.
Also when is the last time you told yourself, I LOVE YOU?
And genuinely meant it."
553,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,"Thank you very much for this episode, guys. I have been feeling stuck for the last couple of years and I have a hard time getting past this feeling. Just listening to you talking about this gave me a surge of inner energy that I need to get past this."
554,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,"I would really wanne hangout with you, I love these kind of conversations."
555,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,"Do you guys plan to upload this on Spotify? I see you posted the teaser for it there, but haven't yet posted this episode days later."
556,Dg0Vt3zlMfM,Hi yess theory can u give me a heart😭
557,40YoA_ltQMA,🙏
558,40YoA_ltQMA,Yes! Great point. You’ll never read in an obituary how social someone was on social media but you will read about how much that person loved their family and friends and socializing in person.
559,40YoA_ltQMA,Hell yes! Getting rid of Facebook was one of the best decisions I ever made.
560,NITIZZz2fQQ,Ironman right on target...😎👍
561,NITIZZz2fQQ,"I absolutely love these guys.
They have first hand information."
562,NITIZZz2fQQ,"Would you please pay my rent, I've lost my job one and half months ago I have been working on daily wages so I can't afford to pay my rent and feed my family, I'll provide my documents or proof if you need!
Need to pay 550$"
563,NITIZZz2fQQ,"When you're young you get your friends based on who makes you feel good to hang with, or with someone you admire and want to be like. While growing up those feelings change a lot. So if you want to stay friend with those persons you have to adapt and talk and keep it up!! Friends are so important in life!"
564,NITIZZz2fQQ,And yet...
565,NITIZZz2fQQ,"Love you guys, keep going on and be strong. Love Amar."
566,RAMfjNvGsTk,Why is Donald Trump allowed to promote anything while your video is playing?? That's the last thing I would ever expect you guys to authorize
567,RAMfjNvGsTk,"A very mature answer from Thomas on what drives you towards autonomy or loyalty. It's not necessarily about co-dependence, it's the cultures that we come from, and how they view the ""burden"" of support. The Global North north prioritizes independence far more than many other areas of the globe, whereas community care is a given in others. Recognizing that it's not about what's wrong and instead about what your norm is, is a huge help when having these conversations!"
568,RAMfjNvGsTk,"I was with someone who called me insane for mentioning this ""people change, there are different versions of someone in a relationship""..."
569,RAMfjNvGsTk,"Lies lies lies only business and cover ups , matts brother did so much harm and damage so his brother had to come back"
570,RAMfjNvGsTk,Matt just stay😭
571,RAMfjNvGsTk,💛🧡💚
572,RAMfjNvGsTk,"I’m so late to the party. I just have to say how much I love watching this conversation. Men expressing and sharing their feelings. What a bleeping concept! 

Congrats gentlemen. I’ve been catching up on your videos old and new. My son who is 26 already made me aware of how late I actually am. Seriously what you guys have created is so beautiful. I feel grateful to have found your channel even if it was just recently.   I feel so inspired. Thanks!

PS. Everything in moderation including saying YES"
573,RAMfjNvGsTk,Love it boysss ❤
574,RAMfjNvGsTk,Matt's story about that girl who said she's been dating 8 different versions of the guy she married made me tear up. Beautiful mentality!
575,RAMfjNvGsTk,i miss matt!
576,RAMfjNvGsTk,I love Matts voice - so calming☺️
577,RAMfjNvGsTk,"So… some day maybe one of y’all will see this comment…. And you’ll say ooooooh there’s something to say YES to!!  To keep within the word limit… YES THEORY OLD BAT CHAPTER!  (Ok maybe collab on the name!). I’m old, but will still say YES!!"
578,RAMfjNvGsTk,Derin
579,RAMfjNvGsTk,i think its visible that matt has some deep resentment toward ammar :(
580,RAMfjNvGsTk,"hoping matt and ammar have been able to managed their disagreement! conflicts are inevitable, even when working with friends. its a sad truth. sometimes friendships are weakened by business, but sometimes business also arises from friendship."
581,RAMfjNvGsTk,God I miss Matt on the videos!
582,RAMfjNvGsTk,Beautifully raw and vulnerable
583,RAMfjNvGsTk,I'm so bothered by the couch blocking a door. HAHA
584,RAMfjNvGsTk,Matt Dajer 😍💖💖💖
585,RAMfjNvGsTk,"awesome point on cultures choosing autonomy and cultures choosing loyalty when one or other has to be chosen

staying globally sensitive is vital, I think, to your global scale and strength. thanks for the discomfort of love expressed in your podcast."
586,o4g8f4sz_d4,Yeah I just played it at 3.5× speed and its complete gibberish I call bluff.  2× speed max.
587,o4g8f4sz_d4,Who says 4 ex speed 😂😂
588,o4g8f4sz_d4,4x??? How's your retention...?
589,o4g8f4sz_d4,That’s incredible how he memorised all of that!!!😃👍☮️❤️
590,o4g8f4sz_d4,So?
591,7LCaWdNw5hs,"all of you are such nice boys, so cute and well-mannered, love the video"
592,7LCaWdNw5hs,Cliff is incredibly handsome
593,7LCaWdNw5hs,“Our Biggest Pains in Our Life are our Biggest Power” 😭😭😭
594,7LCaWdNw5hs,"I've listened to YouTube videos and podcasts on 2x speed for YEARS and no one can understand how I can keep up with it, it's just the way my brain processes the info"
595,7LCaWdNw5hs,Three geniuses in a room
596,7LCaWdNw5hs,"DO 40% of billionaires, really/truly; have dyslexia??  is this -proven??"
597,7LCaWdNw5hs,Really cool that each of them had the same struggles with learning and grasping a topic fully through out life.The roads for each of them were swirled up and sideways but they ended up ending on top. Definitely shows how much the environment has an impact that impacts your brain fundamentals. As well as mindset ! ( bc of your environment)
598,7LCaWdNw5hs,A* not our
599,7LCaWdNw5hs,"Yeah.  I have been listening to a book by Malcolm Gladwell where he talks about this - successful people who are dyslexic  Very eye opening.  I had a different kind of challenge growing up - bedwetting.  You wont believe it. I wet the bed all the way to campus.  I even went to a boarding high school!   Sigh!  Stopped in mid my second year.  And then I noticed in my early 30s, that whenever I moved to a new town, or a new house, I would find myself wetting the bed again.   Thankfully, it doesn't happen now.  It was a very lonely journey figuring out how to stop bedwetting on my own. No support, and ridicule that came from it from family and friends etc.    Interesting how your childhood challenges affect your adulthood. Now lemme not start on my stuttering."
600,7LCaWdNw5hs,"So glad this is getting the attention and concern it should have. I’m the third generation in our family having these challenges. 

You are bringing this important subject to a big audience. Bravo, to you for helping countless people. Their lives will be better because you care. You’re my Super Stars. Sincerely have the love for you. 

Now that I have your attention. I want you to know I’m 70. I have heard you describe the YES FAM being about inspiring young people. Ammar said something about older people in this program. Guess what? This woman hasn’t put herself in the old people box. You won’t either. Just me like always. Feeling like I belong to your family. Love your work, it makes me so happy. 

So glad your in the world❣️"
601,7LCaWdNw5hs,@seedlingtv ~I thought you might want to listen to this interview. These brilliant dyslexics run one of my favorite channels — @YesTheory   ~Enjoy!!!!!
602,7LCaWdNw5hs,"I love this conversation! Thank you for sharing! I'm so grateful! ~ I'm the mama of a dyslexic son and I love love love inspiring stories from folks that are dyslexic. We are taught that dyslexia is a ""learning disability"" but I feel it's a ""learning ability"". I tell my son it's his superpower!!"
603,7LCaWdNw5hs,"I have ADHD, and this was a wonderful episode!"
604,7LCaWdNw5hs,Loving your podcasts guys
605,7LCaWdNw5hs,What an insightful and beautiful conversation.  I'll be sharing this with my friends and family that have similar challenges.  There's so much relief when your challenge has a name.
606,7LCaWdNw5hs,"Both of my son's were also diagnosed with ADHD, my oldest son was put on stratara, I took him off of it when he started having night terrors, he was screaming about spiders crawling all over him, there were no spiders, and that was enough to convince me to not put him anymore meds. The 3 off us all struggle with some form of ADD or ADHD. I also got creative with helping them learn different than most other people. Thanks for talking about this it may help young parents or even other kids not feel so alone."
607,7LCaWdNw5hs,"Guys, I'm 67 and starting over for the 17th time. You have been such an inspiration to me over the last three months since discovering your work. I feel I am slowly becoming the person that I have always been inside. Struggle is not just for the time when we are young, it can be a life long journey. Thank you for your commitment and creativity. The journey is never over. Lee"
608,7LCaWdNw5hs,"Again another incredible episode! Ahh there were parts of this interview that got me a little emotional because I struggled with a lot of learning & mental issues growing up but poorly labeled myself as “stupid” because I watched everyone else do everything so easily. Listening to this episode was like what Ammar explained when he first listened to that TED talk; but for me, this episode is one of those pivotal moments that I gained sooo much insight from and deeply appreciate. Thank you guys 🙏🏼"
609,7LCaWdNw5hs,"My daughter have dyslexia and this Podcast was wonderful, wonderful because sometimes the parents suffer a lot for the situation because you don't want to kid feel insecure. So I love this conversation thank you very much🌻💜  My daughter too have to learn in 2 language English and Spanish so for her is very tough she only have 10 years old and sometimes it's broken for the situation so I really  hear this  Podcat and share it with her🌻💜 Thank you again"

611,YaiWLPyuhDU,❤❤❤❤❤
612,YaiWLPyuhDU,I recently stumbled upon your work and I wanted to contribute cause I think you're really sending a worthy message to the society. But then I saw that you're asking 35 euro for a plain t-shirt which is absurd. I'm not here to rain on your parade but if you want to spread the message you should really consider being more down to earth with prices. All the best from Serbia!
613,YaiWLPyuhDU,"Great Book, Great Videos here!!!😊"
614,YaiWLPyuhDU,"That smile from Matt at the end is priceless! I was genuinely worried when he disappeared from social media, so watching him that happy made me so freaking proud! 
Love you guys"
615,YaiWLPyuhDU,It's going to be tough to see Matt leave
616,YaiWLPyuhDU,Just pre ordered my copy!   I'm not one to read books either.   but watching this channel definitely gave me a different view on being an introvert.  God bless guys!   I will be reading this book as soon as I get it.  I think I haven't read a book since high school.   over 10 years now lol
617,YaiWLPyuhDU,"buying the book asap after the video. Seek Discomfort holds the same fundemantal values as wholesomeness. It's a word barely used for a reason u know <3 thnx guy's and girl's, i trully apreciate ur existence, keep spreading positivity. Namaste :p"
618,YaiWLPyuhDU,❤❤❤
619,YaiWLPyuhDU,💟
620,YaiWLPyuhDU,Damn I need to find a way to deliver that book while on my backpacking in South east asia 😂
621,YaiWLPyuhDU,Love this
622,YaiWLPyuhDU,Have a book signing in LA please! Would be Awesome 🤩
623,YaiWLPyuhDU,Can’t wait to get my hands on the book.
624,YaiWLPyuhDU,"matt liking taylor was so out of left field for me but i love it when my worlds' collide lol, i was waiting for them to do the 1,2,3lgb chant tho ngl lmao"
625,YaiWLPyuhDU,Not me listening to reputation again because of that one delicate scene
626,YaiWLPyuhDU,I WANT THAT BOOK TOO so I can pass it along afterwards plsss 🥹✨♥️♥️♥️ Love from the Philippines 🎉
627,YaiWLPyuhDU,Can't wait to get my copy! This book is going to stay in my personal library (I'll order another one to pass it around to others lol).
628,YaiWLPyuhDU,told 2 people they got a first copy? wtf . Stop scamming
629,YaiWLPyuhDU,"I'm still not 100% sure the reason Matt is leaving, and it's ok that I don't, but it makes me very sad.. I hope the very best for him and I would ask that he shows up in videos from time to time for us to see his face and infectious smile/laughter!"
630,YaiWLPyuhDU,"Nice that books are still valued (along with audible)…because you can share a book, loan it, gift it, or keep it to read again. This is a bit of history. Congrats, Matt. A job so well done. 🐑🐑🇳🇿🇳🇿NZ"
631,8vtkEIAZNi8,First time ive heard your accent
632,8vtkEIAZNi8,We love you Thomas! Thank you for your honesty. I love the serenity prayer- say it every morning!
633,8vtkEIAZNi8,the best is yet to come 🌄 we never stop unfolding
634,8vtkEIAZNi8,"Privileged white guy driving a convertible around Malibou telling us about his first world problems. Cry me a river. Didn't he just go to Syria? Obviously learnt nothing about what suffering actually means. Sorry, but this vid made me vomit."
635,8vtkEIAZNi8,Thank you for this video 🖤
636,8vtkEIAZNi8,"6:44 I can only say Seeking  Discomfort is inquiring within.  Next step, go commando and ditch the apps and sit in true silence."
637,8vtkEIAZNi8,Just gave you a sub. Looks like discomfort is like a compass to something magical.
638,8vtkEIAZNi8,"I’ve been experiencing insomnia the last few months, and it’s been getting worse. It’s been a pretty consistent struggle over the last few weeks. It’s not even 8pm and I’m laying here in bed listening to meditation music because it used to help me so much, but it’s no longer been helping. Back in 2020, I could get into a meditative state rather easily and sit there for several hours. Now, I struggle so much with it, and not understanding why, and not realizing that the practice could regress so much, which has just created this downward spiral into despair. The only thing that used to help me quickly becoming just one more dysfunction in my life. I’ve been slowly coming to the same conclusion as you, that I’ve been avoiding facing myself and the traumas that I’ve experienced the last 6 years, and really over my lifetime.

I was laying here trying to rest, unable to even relax or release the tension in my face and jaw. I’ve been “speaking” to God more and my Spiritual team, and apologized to them because I know I’ve been asking for a lot of help lately and I know they’ve been sending me the messages, but if they could just send me one more positive/uplifting message tonight to help me feel better. I gave it a few moments and had the feeling that the message was ready. I opened YouTube, which is one way I communicate with Spirit, and here was this video. Exactly what I needed to hear, with the added bonus/reminder that meditation is supposed to be about sitting with yourself and all the things that we don’t want to face that we search for comfort to soothe in external ways. Which pretty much always leads to suffering.

Thank you for being vulnerable and sharing this message. It’s helped me so much as I face finding a new job/clients within the next month.

Focus on the things you can control. Focus on the things you can control. Focus on the things you can control. Focus on the things you can control. 😂😂😂❤❤❤"
639,8vtkEIAZNi8,"I deeply appreciate your honesty, vulnerabilety and your over all message. I have practiced zen meditation for many years. Your message really resonates and the wisdom of your practice is coming through. Thank you and gassho (bow)"
640,8vtkEIAZNi8,awwwwwww. I wish i could give you a big hug.
641,8vtkEIAZNi8,watching again.
642,8vtkEIAZNi8,Love this channel!! Y’all are awesome!
643,8vtkEIAZNi8,I honestly kind of needed this. I spent a lot of time running away from how shitty I feel inside and distracting myself (literally with things like youtube). Time to give meditation a go. Thank you so much for sharing this type of message as well!
644,8vtkEIAZNi8,"I do not normally comment on videos, and i do not expect anyone to read. I am however so happy that you are talking about this in a public forum! As someone who has previously always battled my own head its refreshing to see males with so much influence normalizing emotions and talking about struggles <3 Love it. Regards from a long time fan :)"
645,8vtkEIAZNi8,Thank you for the chat. It helps each of us.
646,8vtkEIAZNi8,"I myself have had some major and rare life issues and I knew I would be going through trauma on a personal level.
I was blessed with a lot of caring gentle people who loved me and also had the wisdom to step back and allow me to experience a different kind of grief even though it was difficult I can say I’m ok and it’s been ten years now, my loss never leaves but the pain isn’t as harsh as in the first few years....
Sometimes understanding the seasons of life and letting go and forgiveness all have a place in time. I’m a different person now."

657,0xZG6BMGEO4,More of these!
658,0xZG6BMGEO4,"Introvert people like me limits friends ‘coz we don’t want to misunderstood who we are, we are shy, we want to be alone rather than to meet other but at the same time we are thinking what it looks like to find friends or I rather say how to find that I can call “a good friend”. We have trust issues too. I’m happy to see this content.

Love and greetings from Philippines🇵🇭"

667,0xZG6BMGEO4,"I'm new to Tbilisi, Georgia, here until December 22, and I know no one (adults only speak Georgian and Russian due to the history, the young adults and teens/kids speak Georgian and English). I am 45 years old and would love a way, even with different languages (even with having to use translator), to get together with others. Please let me know if you come this way, or if people in Tbilisi read this, maybe we can meet up. I am poor and can't afford to organize an event. I am in Tsereteli and don't have a car so use the metro or walk."

671,EHHr4uJ8a0s,"We couldn't be happier to finally collaborate with one of our favorite creators in all the platform! Michelle and her team are incredible - they live the Seek Discomfort mentality to the MAX!

So we now want to ask you: who should we partner with in the future? 

p.s: don't forget to subscribe and go check out Michelle's full video on her preparation - it's INSANE!"
672,EHHr4uJ8a0s,"Great Video. 
Thank you for the introduction to Michelle and her Channel. 
Instant Fan."
673,EHHr4uJ8a0s,They fight better than the KSI vs FURY!!!
674,EHHr4uJ8a0s,"Pretty sure when the announcer tell that Michelle was trained by nasa, fbi, and secret service. She knew, she f up 😂"
675,EHHr4uJ8a0s,"Scammers. I’ve lost $500 to Yes Theory. I’ve made multiple purchases and have nothing to show for them. I don’t always get a response from the seek discomfort team, but the 2 times I have, they told me there is nothing they can do about my purchase since it’s past the drop date, so they can only offer me store credit, no refunds. Even though I’ve made multiple purchases, $500 is my current balance, so I have to use it all in one purchase. I don’t agree with anything they say, and as a result of receiving nothing, I’ve unfollowed and will never follow the boys, yes theory, seek discomfort, and all the brands/ people I’ve followed because of them again. I hope more people unfollow Yes Theory so they can address these horrific problems."
676,EHHr4uJ8a0s,"Not sure how I feel about this. Fighting, sport or not. This channels content is spiritual not this. Smh"
677,EHHr4uJ8a0s,"I have to admit my second youngest son, I have 4 put me onto your page about 2 months ago. I watch your videos pretty much dally because I’m going through a very hard time. I filed for a divorce February 1 2023 after 29 years and 3 months. But that wasn’t the worst although I’m still going through it. But last June 25th a day before mine and oldest son’s birthday I got a call from the police telling me I needed to come take care of my mom, she has dementia. I left home in the country and came to the city. I’m not a city person and I hate it here. Anyways my point is I’m very thankful my son told me of your page. Watching you all is the only time in my day I’ve been able to laugh and smile and also feel again. I total have something to look forward too as two of my son’s and I and more than likely my mom, have a new journey coming our way. We are all moving to the next province over because that’s closest to home that I will be able to buy a home for us all after my divorce. It’s going to be awesome Alberta her we come. I’m scared and excited at the same time. How wonderful getting out of your comfort zone is. But I’m going to miss my grad daughter’s but I’ll always drive back to see them. I still hope I’m not making a mistake."
678,EHHr4uJ8a0s,"I challenge to be in my place and stay with my dogs and me challenge myself travel with 0 money around europe, thats my dream to travel but is hard cause I love my dogs and I have fear for not taking care of my girls (dogs)."

You are an absolute machine. One of my favourite inspirations. 😊"

683,EHHr4uJ8a0s,1:06  I love her reaction. 😊❤🎉
684,EHHr4uJ8a0s,punching the shit out of each other and having ppl watch is not Inspirational. crap
685,EHHr4uJ8a0s,Thank you Yes Theory for making such a profound impact on my life. I found Yes Theory back in 2017 and I hope one day I can meet you all in person! Andres really inspired me to finally take action to do my first half iron man with my godfather :)
686,EHHr4uJ8a0s,wow she really inspired me good job guys and Michelle!
687,EHHr4uJ8a0s,"Michelle is such an inspiration. The whole yes crew is of course, but she's one of two creators that have kept me moving when I've wanted nothing more than to give up lately. Seeing her with the yes crew makes my heart melt.

Hey michelle.... way more than one person sees.... I see, if no one else did, but you inspire so many people. You've certainly accomplished your job."
688,EHHr4uJ8a0s,"I will be doing my first 100 mile ultramarathon race next week at SAMO100, thank you so much for teaching me to keep pushing myself and seeking discomfort to achieve beyond what I imagined my capabilities were!!"

695,fNHD5d4f-bc,no need to torture the fish
696,fNHD5d4f-bc,They were such a lovely couple and good sports.  Ideal people for this close to home adventure.   Yes Theory is my favorite YouTube channel as it is so meaningful.
697,fNHD5d4f-bc,Amazing
698,fNHD5d4f-bc,On the boat out to Catalina would be a great place to throw a bottle into the sea?
699,fNHD5d4f-bc,They really littered for views
700,fNHD5d4f-bc,2:26 aw gumon guys you barley even went off the shore hows the bottle supposed to make it to new zealand for me to find
701,fNHD5d4f-bc,"This made me tear up! The fact that the couple was just talking about wanting to go to Catalina and got the extreme gift to do so with such wonderful people. Such an example of synchronicity and as I believe, God’s gifts. The fact that the adventure passed by 3 other people — how many of us are asleep to what adventures lie before us."
702,fNHD5d4f-bc,Yay let's inspire more people to throw plastic in the ocean.
703,fNHD5d4f-bc,Our Brother Sanjay living every Indian guy's dream..

725,QB6Az9kQQuE,"Has anything like this ever been built just because of a movie, outside of somewhere like Universal studios or Disneyland?"
726,QB6Az9kQQuE,I'm confused how they could be doing the show for a decade and he hasn't traveled to New Zealand either for the show or personally. That doesn't make any sense.
727,QB6Az9kQQuE,Stephen Colbert should have Thomas on his show so they can see who knows more about Lord of the Rings

748,rrbg-0ww-yA,Youtube didnt recommend me this video at all i had to come check your channel
749,rrbg-0ww-yA,"Love this! The Wiggles quite literally saved my life! For years I was plagued with a mysterious, debilitating medical condition. I saw many doctors and had many tests run, all to no avail. Then one day in 2005 (or so?) I read an article about the Wiggles, about how a member was retiring due to a condition called orthostatic intolerance. Curious, I Googled that condition. Bells went off in my head as I ticked the boxes of symptoms. Long story short, I found a doctor who specialized in it near me, made an appointment and not only was diagnosed with it, but discovered it was a secondary condition to something much worse! I learned how to manage my symptoms and to have a richer, fuller life as a result. I'm forever indebted to the Wiggles!♥"
750,rrbg-0ww-yA,didnt know how much i would need this video and how much great memories it would bring me !
751,ePgvumj57YA,"Hi Seekers! We wanted to address the comments regarding the lack of information in this video. While we were in Djarindjin, we filmed a lot with Vincent and his family. We learned about their culture and even had the opportunity to try the food they hunted on the beach. Unfortunately, a lot of the footage was corrupted after we left. We were very upset and did our best to salvage what we had. We apologize that we couldn't provide the level of detail we originally planned. Hopefully, we can return in the future and share everything we learned."
752,ePgvumj57YA,The Aboriginal's story in Australia is similar to Canada's indigenous. In Canada The Catholic Schools were responsible.
753,ePgvumj57YA,"Sorry if the spelling is off in my other post, the eyes are going. Blessings all🙏"
754,ePgvumj57YA,"Good day people, l watched a documentary about the geneticists, scientists who came up with the OUT OF AFRICA theory of human evolution & our modern beginnings. They came to OZ after they had published their findings about Africa and took samples of full blood aboriginals across a good section of people. After checking the genome, DNA they think they made a mistake about Africa & according to these expert's they now have concluded OUT OF AUSTRALIA 🌏. I really wasn't surprised as the 65,000 + yrs of 1st Nation Aboriginals in my opinion stretches way to further back. Check out the Landscape pictures painted by Colonists when they were 1st put down & now. The Landscape was prestine, manicured with traps for animals leading to water, 1 way in & then blocked with no way out, easy hunting with animals, fish & fresh water. Look now at the Landscapes now &compare them. What was🎉 beautiful is now overgrown, dead with not as much water. Only in the last few years have the Boofheads in whatever government have asked the aboriginals how to fight FIRE. They have been here for untold generations & now the BOOFHEADS are asking how do you live in Oz with 🔥 fire. The answer was to not cut down tree's because tree's create conditions for rain. The Elder also said it might be to late to read what is coming, not that its completely catastrophic as l seen it, its because they can't read the weather as before. The innuit are in the same situation, but with blizzards. They can't read the weather as before as the change is upon them before realising it. Many don't return from their trips. We have to get all the knowledge of the 1st nations on the planet and try to understand that they lived with the Land & didn't exploit our Mother Earth & she can provide for us all. We can't change the greedy, powerful and influential who are the minds behind what we see. But if more of us plebs see heaven on earth instead of what most are seeing now your view of the World will change. It's up to each person to see Only the good in everything, or if it is bad to let it go. We can't & shouldn't try to stop our thoughts and emotions, just dont get hooked by them. Come back to the gift from God the PRESENT &keep opening presence for Infinity. The Aboriginals & other 1st nations talk about the Golden age, here its the Dreamtime. I read the 2012 ending was really the start of AQUARIUS on the Zodiac &we are heading up towards the period of the Dreamtime. They think its the Solar Flares from the Sun that will, might highten our vibration to a higher frequency & therefore consciousness. We won't be around when or if it happens, but you never know. I didn't realise either that the 1st Nations have their own United Nations & meet, but l'm not sure how long. Have a guess who is revered for their knowledge and Wisdom. A Egyptian Prince came to OZ & he ended up dying in Oz as the hydroglithics said. They said a mad Russian drew the Gliths, but they are up a decent height on a sheer wall, also it was Ancient Egyptian & that reading of them let alone carving out a story in the Gliths was virtually impossible, plus he was mad & even a team of men today would have trouble getting to them. Its getting the equipment to the site, not that we haven't the equipment. We also had a pyramid in Gympy which the earliest settlers used the stone to build with. Then they tried to destroy it before the people found out about it because goodbye land if a pyramid was there. Oh, the army used the Pyramid as Target practice. All of this you will find on YouTube. The geneticists were at it in NZ as well. The Waka who were in NZ before us Moaris l think as when the Tuhoe 1st landed in NZ some group of people were there & we intermingled to form one tribe, l'm sure thats how it goes. Anyway the Waka are absolutely beautiful with light coloured skin & the most beautiful jade eyes, gorgeous. A Elder said to the geneticists that their journey started in Persia & from there they went to the indus valley for a time. This elders words not mine & she said they were in India when the Mahabharata happened. God's & flying vehicles at war & it was a massive disaster as we know today. They left to the southern tip of India and from there after a time left &crossed to todays Porta Rico &then travelled south to Bolivia. After a few hundred years of living peacefully with the natives they were forced to move by the inhabitants, but not sure why. From there the Elder Lady said they travelled by boat to the Polynesia islands where it was they who brought root vegetables, potatoes &sweet potato to the islands. Then they went south to NZ where they mostly live. The absolutely amazing thing about their story is the Geneticists said they had Persian blood &it looked like they originated there. I love this stuff because to me is the time for us to know what we truly are & why we are here. I have my view on it & its just perfect, l'm just understanding Jesus, Buddha & all beautiful human beings throughout memory more with age & hopefully wisdom. We are one, everything is the Creator, one Consciousness with all using that consciousness of the Creator. Jesus & Buddha knew this Buddha found it, Jesus like was born with awareness, but he the Christos in all of us never forgot. We are all the sons and daughters of God said Jesus.  When Buddha was asked if there was a God & he just smiled. Many say his non answer was a no. Buddha was a happy jovial man always smiling & in my opinion he was smiling thinking ""FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF"", makes perfect sense to me."
755,ePgvumj57YA,News flash...all indigenous people are melinated. And this happened almost everywhere in the world...not just in Australia.
756,ePgvumj57YA,I hope one day.... every body will wake up and realize the mass atrocities that white people have caused on indigenous populations...they are the real evils
757,ePgvumj57YA,"All over the world, CHURCH has done the most horrible things and is still doing. And all of this under the flag ""God and Jesus and the bible"". Makes me vomit....damned hypocrits!!!"
758,ePgvumj57YA,And they have never invented anything else then a stick that returns when you throw it away.
759,ePgvumj57YA,"There is no such thing as oldest culture. Moreover all human cultures change . It is probably fasionable and nice to talk about things continuous vis a vis aborigines especially by semi whites of the latte set who are a little too romantic. From what the anthropologists have reported the culture was dynamic and adapting through time. This means languages and dialects too disappeared and changed. The landscapes and climate changed to give rise to new stories and to the death of others. Paintings were renewed and over painted and the signifigance of some emphasised or forgotten. What the semi whites do is to take some stories they have read about and portray these as the truth about aboriginal culture.
Pascoe had Madre an artform of this process. No person  alive today hadn't been subject to cultural change  in some form...it is false to claim that culture is  either continuous and/or unchanging."
760,ePgvumj57YA,"300 000 years old artifacts Kenya. . Scientific fraud more like it.
  Oldest culture that never evolved maybe"
761,ePgvumj57YA,"I'm currently backpacking in Australia and was surprised to learn that the recent referendum to grant more rights to Indigenous Australians failed to pass. When I initially saw the polling booths, I thought it would be a straightforward ""yes"" vote, assuming that anyone with common sense would vote in favor."
762,ePgvumj57YA,"In the lands that would come to be known as 'the Americas', the kidnapping of children was at the hands by the 'holy men' who accompanied the invading European christian terrorists.
First the child's head was shaved, their clothes were burned, NO Native language was permitted and NO Native food was available.  The p[rocess of 'scalping' was instituted by these vile 'holy men' as a more efficient way of computing bountys as transporting whole bodies was 'too difficult', but a 'bounty hunter' could cram 50 or so scalps in their saddle bags.  The scalps were then used by the 'holy men' as decorative objects and as barter and trade.
In Australia, the English invented the term 'aboriginal' as the English looked upon the Native peoples as ABNORMAL and they were considered to be 3/5ths Human!
The Native Australian peoples were corralled and raised for their BODY PARTS, a practice which survived into the 20th Century!   
Among the items most sought after by English 'Society' were tobacco pouches made of young Native's TESTICLE SACS!"
763,ePgvumj57YA,"Man, so short and didn’t really pay proper respect to such an ancient culture? 13 minutes 😂😂😂😂 seek discomfort LMFAO"
764,ePgvumj57YA,Good ole cannibalism
765,ePgvumj57YA,"60000 years .
..you cant be serious. 
.there NOTHING to support that clsim...LITURALLY NOTHING.."
766,ePgvumj57YA,"Loads of emotional bs here! The semi aborigenous urban lot have embraced this instead of truth ! 
Loads of made up lore here too!  True lore is passed down by traditionally authorised initiated song men only and only to the initiated who were entitled to that knowledge. The knowledge has been lost because song boards were destroyed and white hybridization meant that initiations could not take place because of wrong blood mix. Any initiations that do occur are of quite recent construct."
767,ePgvumj57YA,"what an awesome video, great job going into a this with curiosity and compassion instead of ignorance and hate. 

it’s also awesome to see knowledge from a culture that has been passed down for 80,000+

…and somehow there seems to be less hate and ignorance in the commentary than usual when there is a video about first nations peoples, hopefully it’s a sign on change."
768,ePgvumj57YA,"I can never get a straight answer

WHY WERE THEY STOLEN?
What was the motive, reason, desired outcome?

Were there any positive aspects to it? cheers"
769,ePgvumj57YA,There’s what’s his face the dude that married the queen of England….Wth
770,ePgvumj57YA,"Aboriginals never moved on from their stone-age culture. Most others did. There is a quite a  bit of virtue signalling from this White bloke. And stolen generation is really just a political racist term for the attempt to SAVE kids from their negligent abusive parents. Yep, shouldn't have bothered. Also SAVED them from their ancient primitive stone-age culture. It was very harsh. Thankyou the British for settling, exploring and developing Australia to make it one of the best countries in the world."

780,O4pPLeaJaXk,Correct me if the rules of this game were lame and too much of gadgets were involved and so were weird powerups. Along with using subscribers to help you. As a viewer the excitement was just to low.
781,O4pPLeaJaXk,this was so much fun :D
782,O4pPLeaJaXk,The video was kinda boring cos the rules made it way too easy for the seeker
783,O4pPLeaJaXk,Love y’all’s adventures but GOD doesn’t need a damn. HE CAN WALK ON WATER.
784,O4pPLeaJaXk,Being a stalker this days is so easy 😅
785,O4pPLeaJaXk,Hide better next time

809,2H59nXdZmzo,i can't believe it.. i literally live round the corner from the saints fc.. i'm so sad </3

818,Qy9pgZ2Atok,"As a recent new subscriber,  I wonder how my life may have changed if I had been watching your channel 40 years ago. Being almost 62 and very much young at heart and mind, I keep wondering how I might reinvent myself by being inspired by your adventures and experiences. 
I look forward to watching past episodes and your adventures in 2023. Love your channel."

823,Qy9pgZ2Atok,"WHAT IS UP YES FAM!!! I have a big or small ask for all of you at Yes Theory. I am getting married in South Africa August 26th...I'm pretty sure you all know where I am going with this hahaha. So, I am originally from South Africa and moved to America  when I was 12 (about 14 years ago) with my mom, dad, and sister but all of my family is still in S-A. We do not get to see our family often, only about every 4 years, but now I get to see them 2 years in a row because my cousin and I are both getting married. Which actually leads me to the reason for this comment.....My cousin is getting married on Sept 2nd, the weekend after mine, and he has been a supporter of Yes Theory since the very beginning (I'm not kidding). Because the first and only thing he asked us to order and bring back for him when we went to visit was ""Seek Discomfort"" merch because he did not want to risk not receiving it due to the high risk of mail being stolen there - He even has a ""Seek Discomfort"" tattoo on his arm now. Long story short, I have been thinking of what I could give him as a present but the only things I have came up with involves Yes Theory. I would be INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL if you guys would help me give him the most perfect and unexpected gift. I know asking for you guys to come to his wedding is a big ask but on the off chance you're available you have an official invite to crash his wedding. If not, it would be so amazing if he can receive a video or facetime from you guys! :)
Not sure how you reach out to your supporters but just incase (without posting my personal contact information) you can message me on tiktok: @mel_not_gibson"
824,Qy9pgZ2Atok,simple but honest. liked it ;) thx guys.
825,Qy9pgZ2Atok,Love you mates!
826,Qy9pgZ2Atok,Syria and turkey need lights and garden tools during blizzard conditions they need gloves and heaters water and food
827,Qy9pgZ2Atok,A major network has stolen Iceman
828,Qy9pgZ2Atok,"Amar. You guys have kept me hypnotized with your videos for the last couple of years, with all the things you have acomplished, and I did love the Iceman movie. 
Amazing job, truly, heartfelt. 
I would love to see you do a dual movie about your story. The ""Hollywood"" version of how Yestheory came to be...shiny actors, getting together to get the youtube channel going, and the success story after, Hollywood style, like Elton Johns ""Rocketman""... and at the same time, making another, a ""reality"" story, the trueish story behind the scenes, an honest story more like the ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" of Queen. 
But, in spirit of both theese movies, you should cast other people in the roles of yourselves.... Shiny Hollywood, downtoearth Bohemian...
Aight, good to see you again ;)"
829,Qy9pgZ2Atok,Never trust a man without socks in his sneakers.... Ailens are taking over. F ight with all you got Thomas.  Your friends have been taken over.

833,8Yy2dj6IvVE,"it's too bad the 2 of you didn't learn how to do that leg windmill thing... was that because it was too hard to do physically? i was just curious. i know a lot of these dancing, and in diff styles, can look easier than it is to accomplish. running man for instance. idk why but that eludes me. heartrate jacks up too."
834,8Yy2dj6IvVE,Tommy I love your positive vibes and seeing you in front of the camera. Keep growing and inspiring all us shy kids out there!
835,8Yy2dj6IvVE,Bro really learned it faster than me
836,8Yy2dj6IvVE,"so I'm taking a break from preparing for a pitch I need to present in less than 24 hours.. and watching a video from yes theory or seek discomfort never disappoints to remind me of important things I should tell myself, tommy said great things that gave me my energy and hope back... even though what I'm working on is VERY FAR from break dancing haha... but that's the beauty of it.. healthy mentality is really what will give u everything and make everything work. thank you"
837,8Yy2dj6IvVE,Love black culture but not black people...typical
838,8Yy2dj6IvVE,"Man what a fun video! You got so much better, so much confidence and determination through an uncomfortable process! ""It's not a loss, it's a lesson."""
839,8Yy2dj6IvVE,So can you teach me how to break dance please
840,8Yy2dj6IvVE,"Man, I'm 40, turning 41 this year. My health sucks for real, but I'm trying to make myself beatbox. I can drop some beats already, but, I still ain't no beatbox jedi yet. But I'm stuck, I can't improve any more than I have now sadly."
841,8Yy2dj6IvVE,"Pro dancer here, i been a pro streetdancer since I was 18 but only started to learn bboying at 38yrs old, still going now at 54yrs old, it's never too old to learn, respect to you, it's simple practise makes perfect."

852,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,"Never accept anyone’s shortcomings, do it for yourself and never worry about others because most of them are all scared cowards living in their little reality world that society deems correct, create ur own reality and enjoy the one and only life you have been given, because when it’s time to leave this world the only thing you will think about is your life, not theirs.."
853,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,Watch now at www.theicemanfilm.com
854,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,Where can i watch the film?
855,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,That's soooo true! I had a very similar experience from school!
856,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,"Woah I had never thought of that. A lot of the time, people telling you what you can’t do haven’t even experienced or attempted whatever your goal might be"
857,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,This looks incredible!
858,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,"I love the mindset of these guys! It reminds me of how I have lived my life not listening to others, but doing what I know is possible. Every kid should be watching this content. In the US, the majority of people have turned to comfort and never truly ever challenging themselves whether it is business/work, sports, or outdoor activities. We need a revival of looking up to the BOLD - the innovators, the risk takers. Challenge your mind and your body!"
859,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,I would love to watch this. Why can’t it be streamed online? Or on their website? Just put it behind a pay wall.
860,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,"“He told me I couldn’t swim 4 kilometers in ice water”
I’m gonna need some context here"
861,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,"""We believe in a future where filmmakers don’t need big checks to make a big impact.""  but its nowhere to be watched, unless u pay? and come over to denmark? how is this working? #Scrooghe"
862,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,When Will it be released for streaming? 🥶💙
863,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,"I really look forward to the day I get to watch the full length documentary, but from this clip alone and the prestige & reputation the crew behind Yes Theory have, I know this documentary deserves the short list nomination. Massively proud of everyone thats put hours upon hours into this project, and its been amazing to see how much Yes Theory has grown over the last few years, from the creators of a Snapchat series to an Oscar worthy production company. Incredible work 👏"
864,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,"as an aspiring actress who just moved to London from her home town, Brisbane, I am constantly getting unsolicited advice & doubts from people who have never worked in the industry. Love this message. LET'S GET THIS TO THE OSCARS."
865,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,Why do I feel like he's reading from a script?
866,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,lets go
867,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,"Honestly if that wins an oscar, i’ll start watching the award show again!"
868,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,"nah you can't do that, you're just youtubers, you can't be part of the oscars. And I would know, because I have actually seen films that won real oscars and they weren't made from content creators. So yeah better invest your time in studying something proper and get a real job, it's time to take responsibility like an adult."
869,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,"Movie wasn’t shortlisted, time to put it on the main channel to get views now, the dream is over"
870,B-Y4H3rk7Ac,"I helped out at the premier in Berlin... guys this movie was INSANE! Everyone there was mind-blown afterwards... on top of that Amar's and Anders' speech afterwards left us in awe - it was a truly beautiful thing to see how grateful, happy they were and how deeply committed they are to this message - every single person in that room could feel it. It was THAT powerful.

I sincerely hope all of you can watch it as soon as it hits theatres in your country! #limitationsareperceptions"
871,5B1tJ7roKXY,It was such a gift to learn from this community and experience their vibrant way of life. The people of Loma Linda have such a special place in my heart!

874,5B1tJ7roKXY,I live here been living here since I turned 18 only 5 years ago still have never participated in a marathon. I did hike once but stepped on a 6ft rattle snake and haven’t gone back
875,5B1tJ7roKXY,"the ""blue zone"" concept is a scam."
876,5B1tJ7roKXY,Italy and Japan have something to say to these people about their staunch opposition to alcohol. If there’s one thing I’ve learned from virtually everyone who’s lived past 80 (including my own profession as a bartender in a small town) daily consumption of alcohol seems to be one of the biggest keys to longevity.
877,5B1tJ7roKXY,Crazy that you can learn a new view on life from YouTube.  Kudos guys!
878,5B1tJ7roKXY,"They way that man said to turn red zones into blue zones, that look on his face, almost feels like it was subliminally political, even if accidental"
879,5B1tJ7roKXY,Very cool! Good video yall!
880,5B1tJ7roKXY,"that salvation army is in san bernardino, you cheaters hahah"
881,5B1tJ7roKXY,new video that i feel as a european that is mostly spend on flights. i feel mostliy disattacheted form youtubers that have most likkey  have unlimmited cash to make inspiring vieos. as a person that struggles with alcohol abuse i dream to make at least one person sober that don't drink. it is just a phase and as soon as you get out fo collage i know that's where you find like minded people. remember a stranger is a friend that you naver met before :)
882,5B1tJ7roKXY,Adventist community! ❤❤
883,5B1tJ7roKXY,The 104 year old ladies skin!!!! WOW
884,5B1tJ7roKXY,"I had someone close in my life when I was younger that lived to 101.  I notice that eating vegetables is a key.  Wish I could ask her but would love to know how long many of this community stopped eating meat.  Sure many other addictions are in my life, but eating meat is a daily habit for me."
885,5B1tJ7roKXY,"he is not bad, unlike the australian guy and the younger brother of one the founding member of the seek discomfort, but never like as the original group"
886,5B1tJ7roKXY,"My grandfathers mother is still alive to this day and shes now turning 104 this year...it is true about the diet part cause she eats a lot of vegetables and her meals have less salt in them and she drinks a lot of water and only tea no coffee,she sleeps early too she never go past bedtime and most importantly her faith a lot of people say my grandfather might live long like my Great Grandma too cause he follows her mums eating habits and he's really health concious 😊😊 I hope everyone lives healthy and long..."
887,5B1tJ7roKXY,I partly grew up in Loma Linda and I got so yesterday when I saw you do the hike I did with my dad every other weekend!!

When in New York we went to a liquor shop to buy wine and the cashier insisted to show him our visas but we kept telling them we had no visas because we didn't need them for our holiday, but at the time I didn't understand that it is probably not common to not have visa."

925,nnYAgodUDKU,"I thought about something for a long time and the part of the video when Tommy said how he can’t get used to living there cause of the constant work and travel, made me finally say it. I imagined myself in your shoes. As a biggest overthinker (trust me, it is insane how much I overthink) I thought about feeling maybe overwhelmed from all the amazing experiences that are followed with ofc less amazing ones. I tend to be really nostalgic so If I don’t get some time to process what I experienced (one of the stories you guys share from around the world, for example), I will start thinking about stuff that will bother me and make me feel not in peace. I wondered, how do you guys feel with all the work and constant travel? You are all grown up and I wish I can hear something like this from you , since I follow you for years now. :)"
926,nnYAgodUDKU,"Right, so I don’t think people understand how much work is behind all of these videos, clothing, just finding contacts from people in other countries to share their stories, getting the tickets, etc.
I still can’t imagine what the process of leading YesTheory looks like… I am sure it is a lot and thinking how you all developed it so high is mind blowing to me. Learning all the ways to do it in the meantime must had been stressful."
927,nnYAgodUDKU,"Southern coast better, a big city and an old one doesn't seem the go 😆😋"

955,5C9VI9PWvS8,these guys really know how to name these pups.
956,5C9VI9PWvS8,awesome keep doing what your doing there nothing but big dogs that need love
957,5C9VI9PWvS8,Stories like this one are why I hope to become a zoologist and work on education and conservation
958,5C9VI9PWvS8,can we talk about the vampire painting on the sanctuary's wall ? 😂😂
959,5C9VI9PWvS8,this is what heroes looks like❤
960,5C9VI9PWvS8,I've had a passion for wolves since I was a kid and love seeing things like this. Wish I could've been apart of something like that .
961,5C9VI9PWvS8,Hi from Brazil! I just watched the other video and went online to get to know more about them! I’ll sure find ways to contribute and maybe even book a visit to the wolves! They’re precious! ❤
962,5C9VI9PWvS8,LOVE❤❤❤❤❤❤ THE SHIRT!!!
963,5C9VI9PWvS8,If I was able I would do donate the world to you!!! I wish I could help but all I can do is offer myself as help!! I would help for the rest of my life
964,5C9VI9PWvS8,I would so LOVE to move on your property and help raise wolves with you three!!! You truly are touched by God! I love this so much and love those wolves even more!! I love so many animals and my dream is to help raise wild life animals!! I hope you get cabins built but I would stay in a 4 season tent with a stove and a/c lol.
965,5C9VI9PWvS8,"I'm dutch, in the Netherlands the wolfs were extinct until about 2 years ago when some wolfs came from germany to the Netherlands where they began breeding and forming packs to this day, so we know how it is and we're excited we got em again. That's why we all support them so much, me myself actually donated €120 just because I really think it's a good goal. Thanks for your video and showing those awesome people out there, they really inspire me"
966,5C9VI9PWvS8,I am unfortunately broke this year on money but I seriously wish to save wolves and any endangered species if humanity are causing this then we really really need to desperately fix it there are so many amazing animals that we have here on earth and I seriously have especially recently noticed how much harm we really are doing to the planet and the species that live alongside us and I sometimes think we as a species take this for granted
967,5C9VI9PWvS8,respect man🥂🥂
968,5C9VI9PWvS8,You guys are amaZing. I wish i have alot of money to help this and all the animal care around the world. Wish you guys all the best. Keep spreading the kindness guys. Loveya. ❤

977,MD5awtIRaQg,"Wow You should have kept Yes Theory boys . I stopped watching as the pandemic happened , It sucked I understand . I'm still a big fan but I gave up. I need the weekly videos back and travel. I'm rocking a Seek shirt as we speak.  I miss you guys."

Four years ago I was in Paris for school I didn’t get to really experience it because I had 12 classes in a week….. I miss it so much yesterday marked my 4yrs of being on a plane to live out my next few months to just have Covid ruin my dreams. I wish I had more time to do all the things and go to the places I dreamt of but life had better expectations. I still dream of the day that I can go back. But a dream is just a dream right now. 

I wished I knew the yes fam 4years ago but just recently in this past year stumbled on them. I could only imagine what it could be like to travel the world."
993,oLBvStBHPKQ,"Nice work. You're an inspiring editor. Love the cuts, the random animation, and perfect music. Let's go skydiving"
994,oLBvStBHPKQ,omg the jose gonzalez song from the secret live of walter mitty!

1004,oLBvStBHPKQ,that hit straight into my Heart. So opening! It makes me so emotional knowing i have found my tribe as well here in australia after traveling for so long. I trust the universe that i can stay here for forever with them ! <3
1005,oLBvStBHPKQ,"In 2019, I was walking around park as a tourist in Munich, and saw this meet up. I didnt know anything about it, I didnt know about guys from Yes Theory... Some people from meet up said, come join us, and few seconds later I was meeting up a lot of interesting people, dancing in the rain. It was very special day, and now I have incredible memories from that day :) Later, people told me it was intended meet up, I thought everyone was randomly there like me :D Im happy that I joined that day, always had some curiosity and positivity strings for trying something new... That summer was very important for me, kind of turningpoint for my life, and its interesting how all right things come to you when you need them the most. Im glad that I found out about the whole community and bravery for seeking discomfort. Years later, Im still trying new ""scary"" things, coming out from comfort zone reguraly and I can say, sometimes its hard, sometimes its scary, but in the end, those are most precious days, and a way to grow up"
1006,oLBvStBHPKQ,I love the choice of using Jose Gonzalez near the end.
1007,oLBvStBHPKQ,"That video made me so happy, thank you!!"
1008,oLBvStBHPKQ,"Aaaw man, I can't believe I missed this. I live only 2 hours away from Munich. 
Does anyone know about an actual Yes Theory Community in Munich?"
1009,oLBvStBHPKQ,Tbh it's sad that this isn't on the main channel.

1049,hGcr2MzBgjc,"“ difficulty to able to train in Saudi Arabia “ ???? I mean that’s absurd to say and that’s totally not true!

1052,ET3Dve1boJU,"Im not sure how you got into Syria but I am so envious. I have tried numerous airlines but due to bans, you cannot even fly into the country anymore. I am appreciative of the fact you were able to get in. I have been studying the topics you address and places you visit in this video and so I’m grateful. I do know that the Western Galilean form of Aramaic which Yeshua spoke definitely does not exist. In fact, since there is no proof of its existence in its origin in writing, only  few have knowledge of it. I know of one resource only in which to learn it and even that is limited."
1053,ET3Dve1boJU,"Can anyone dare to plunder Mecca, which is their holy place. I just abhor them."
1054,ET3Dve1boJU,"We learn Aramaic at schools in Israel as well, we also pray some prayers in Aramaic in every daily Jewish life!  it is a part of our history as Jewish people, I took some Aramaic classes myself, in Hebrew we have lots of Aramaic words, those are very similar sister languages with a common origin and history, I would not be surprised id we are genetically related to those brave people of this village as we are historically from the same origin and Jesus was Jewish as well. Shalom."
1055,ET3Dve1boJU,getting a  yt hotel advertisement while seeing the safir maaloula hotel being destoryed is kinda ...
1056,ET3Dve1boJU,"Thank you very much for video!
I'm from Maaloula.
God bless you."
1057,ET3Dve1boJU,3:15 that head bump haha
1058,ET3Dve1boJU,Its a beautiful place. Too bad its difficult to visit
1059,ET3Dve1boJU,When he said “Ehh it’s ok. This is Syria.” …it literally shattered my soul 😢 my heart hurts for him n all of the people of Syria. May God protect them. 😣♥️
1060,ET3Dve1boJU,"Anything of great value stolen in churches or temples would probably be found in a rich guy's house in europe or USA, always been the case"
1061,ET3Dve1boJU,3:16 Anyone saw the cameraman bang his head? 😂
1062,ET3Dve1boJU,"Funny though you are from Sweden, if you jsut went 30Km south of Stockholm to a city called Södertälje there you will find the largest concetration of us Arameans in the World."
1063,ET3Dve1boJU,You put the mainsteam media to shame with your trip to Syria. Please keep doing stuff like this.
1064,ET3Dve1boJU,Did you get to visit the Kurdish regions up north or is it still too dangerous? All the information I could find was horribly out of date.
1065,ET3Dve1boJU,"0:25 
Actually it's not one City where Aramaic still spoken 
There are rather two neighbouring muslim villages where people still speak Aramaic untill now
Additionally, there are too many villages in Hama and northern Syria that speak aramaic but that was unfortunately not highlighted"
1066,ET3Dve1boJU,"Loxe your work, but I found it a little annoying how you kept referring to terrorists as ""rebels"" even as your hosts kept referring to them ad what they actually were, terrorists."
1067,ET3Dve1boJU,You guys are awesome.  Such beautiful work.
1068,ET3Dve1boJU,I love the Yes Theory brand however they are so far away from middle America
1069,ET3Dve1boJU,Do you know meaning of god in aramaic??
1070,ET3Dve1boJU,The Syria episode has been my favourite #YesTheory ever. Amazing. Great people.
1071,hX5i8J0LCjI,WHAT SHALL WE DO NEXT? MOTOGP BIKE...RALLY CAR...PLANES 👀 💨 ????
1072,hX5i8J0LCjI,Please !!!! Take me there !!!!
1073,hX5i8J0LCjI,The v10 edited in in the intro :(
1074,hX5i8J0LCjI,"i dont wanna be that guy but wow - cosima is unbelievably beautiful. f1 is my absolute favourite thing on earth and has been the only bright spot in some really really dark past couple of years. and seeing her enjoy this experience brought tears to my eyes. many many people cant imagine what stuff like this can mean to someone that loves and lives a sport. e.g. meeting your absolute biggest idol in football, playing a couple passes with them, experiencing courtside at an nba game & meeting steph or lebron, driving in an f1 car.
moments like these give people surreal amounts of joy that often times cant be replicated. truly once in a lifetime moments, that can give people hope in life or provide someones last chance of experiencing something unbelievable (like make a wish type stuff). thats why this brought tears to my eyes. you can see the joy in her eyes, in german we say „ihre augen flunkern/sprühen vor freude“. its incredibly heartwarming and i truly hope to one day experience something like this before its too late for me ❤️

ich hoffe du hattest den schönsten tag deines lebens liebe cosima, schöne (& rasante, lol😵‍💫) grß aus berlin. bleib‘ die gleiche frohnatur, die du zumindest durch das video hier zu sein scheinst; ich hoffe du verlierst nie dein einzigartiges lächeln & eben dieses funkeln in den augen:)"
1075,hX5i8J0LCjI,"DTS has without a doubt introduced F1 to a huge audience that would have normally not watched motorsports. I am one of those people, Now I'm so deep into F1 that I am setting alarms to watch races that start in the dawn hours of my time zone."
1076,hX5i8J0LCjI,you guys should reupload this video this would get alot more views
1077,hX5i8J0LCjI,soo so late to this but am a recent addition to the watching community - I'd love to experience a remote seekers camping event - designed for whole families-  now that would be amazing.
1078,hX5i8J0LCjI,Love you guys. I'd go anywhere lol. Father of 3 can barely afford going to the grocery store.
1079,hX5i8J0LCjI,"You guys should come to the 7:32  biggest sporting event in the world. There are over 400,000 people that flood one stadium for an entire week. The indy 500 in indianapolis indiana. That would be a great video!!"
1080,hX5i8J0LCjI,I wish one day i wd have this experience am a huge f1 fan!
1081,hX5i8J0LCjI,I'd probably be more excited about meeting Christian Klien and Patrick Friesacher than about the ride itself lmao. Great to see a Yes Theory x F1 crossover.

1090,hX5i8J0LCjI,"I literally just live 10 Minutes away from the Red Bull Ring. This is kind of crazy how close you guys were to my home. Anyways, it is THE experience you have to make if you come to this region here. I am also there 3 or 4 times a year to work when there are events like the F1 or the Moto GP.
Crazy Stuff :))"
1091,BegNujBbCTg,What a wild experience! So stoked to have experienced this with you guys! When in Nepal am I right?
1092,BegNujBbCTg,Sometimes the fear of losing the approval and appreciation of an audience is the bravest choice. Glad you consumed a discreet amount given where you were.
1093,BegNujBbCTg,"Kind of like invitro, if it takes that much effort and you literally have to jump through hoops to get it done, it's not for you to acquire"
1094,BegNujBbCTg,"Mad Honey is not very safe to ingest. A person can get Mad Honey disease/ Grayanotoxin poisoning. These honeys are produced by bees that feed on azaleas/ rhododendron nectars. These nectars contains andromedotoxins that are poisonous when ingested into the stomach. Too much ingestion of these will cause nausea, vomitting, hallucinations, low blood pressure and may even lead to multiple organ failure..."
1095,BegNujBbCTg,"the flowers the bees use produce Grayanotoxin  What does Grayanotoxin do to the body?
Grayanotoxin acts on sodium ion channels and muscarinic receptors,     leading to cardiac disorders     (hypotension and different rhythm disorders including bradycardia, brady dysrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, nodal rhythm, atrioventricular block, and complete atrioventricular block) and respiratory depression.   i would not try this mad honey if i were you!"
1096,BegNujBbCTg,"Hey beautiful community after travelling to Nepal less than 1 year after the earthquake in 2015 that killed over 9,000 people. I was breaking up with my partner of 10 years. We hiked for a week together reflecting on a 3rd of a lifetime we shared with each other. She spent 3 months, then I spent 3 months in India and Nepal, we shared a week in between our trips. She left and I was alone in Nepal having a life changing experience learning about meditation and yoga while immersed in the Himalayas. At the end of my trip in Nepal I got really sick, I had never been this sick before in my life, I was alone, cold and scared. Stuck in my small room faraway from any one I knew. I bought a lemon and ginger tea from a small stall and the man asked me if I was ok. I replied that I wasn't, he could clearly see how sick I was. His name was kailash and he took my number, room number and hotel, he would make me soups and bring me electrolytes, medicine and water. He made me feel that some one cared for me, I honestly thought I was dying. I had to cancel all my flights and eventually make it into the hospital. This was the last time i saw this beautiful man. We stayed I contact over 7 years, we would talk regularly, at the time Kailash and a good job for Kathmandu standards as chef for the german embassy, he also had a small chai stall. 2 years before Covid, kailashs wife was on a public bus and it crashed and she broke her back very severely and was bend ridden for 1 year, kailash had to travel 1.5 hours each way on crowded  buses to be with his wife after working 10 hour days, he eventually had to take time of to look after his wife, his income stream lessening. We would talk and it would break my heart.  This is only the start of his problems as started to have heart problems and was in and out of hospital himself, many times I wouldn't hear from him and worry and there was nothing I can do as I lived in Australia. I raised money twice through myself friends and family to help pay for hospital fees. Covid comes along and kailash loses his job as the German ambassadors leave Nepal 🇳🇵 Kaialsh was in his mid 50s at the time. Nepal faced severe lockdowns, the economic crisis having a way bigger effect than the actual death count. Nepal is very based on tourism, like Bali is etc. He got a small payout at the end ogmf his dismissal. Fast forward, the conversations i would have during the lockdowns as I'm receiving money from the government because of covid in Australia would bring me to tears everytime, I felt helpless so I would send money to him for supplies etc. Lock downs finish and Nepal is very slow to receive any tourism, the country is still rebuilding after the earthquake 8 years later. Kailash is excited because he has potential work in India, he keeps telling me, so we were excited for him.....until I found out he's being treated as a second class citizen and being imprisoned in a rich familes compound some where in India. He wasn't allowed to even leave to buy biscuits and was held at ransom with threats of not being paid at the end of the month, there was multibe Nepalese working there under the same conditions working 12 hour days, 6 days a week. Again this was breaking my heart, as Nepal had such a profound impact on my life, I just didn't know what to do, I really felt helpless. He had another experience similar to this after he left that place with out any pay. He would tell me how they treat him like a slave. I told go back yo Nepal and your local community as no one deserves this treatment. Fast foward again. I'm a DJ in Byron Bay, Australia. I'm involved in organising dance parties and events. I realized I could use this as a platform to try and raise money for kailash to open a small chai or vegetable stand and try and  try and receive some  steady income. So I paid for a beautiful poster, I organised local musicians and djs to donate their skills and time towards a fundraiser called 'Fruitjam'. I started the donation of with $250, I supplied food and alcohol to the artists playing and i managed to get all the equipment donated (lights, dj equipment, marquess etc it was a Lot of work we had about 50 beautiful humans come and dance and helo the cause. My goal was $2k and i raise about $1000. I would publicly share the journey and always tell kaialsh I'm coming to help you my brother, we become close over the 7 years on the phone and I kept telling him I care for you and I promise to come over with the mone, he would smile and the hope in his eyes would make reflect on the things I would be stressing over, I couldn't stop thinking how good this made me feel knowing he had hope and also noticed how much people at events would spend on drugs going up their noses and how much just $50 can help a human in need. I couldn't stop thinking of the disparity and it's slowly been changing my brain chemicals and I it was like a high. I practice the mantra 'The more you give the more you get' and its true. Giving is an easy way on the Dharma path of growth and healing of our own traumas. Another thing that influenced my thinking was losing my home and possessions in Australia's worst floods in the Northern Rivers, NSW, Australia. It was life changing, we still have thousands of peope homeless in Lismore and the surrounding areas. The power of community and love is what saved me, and realising what we are cable of as resilient loving beings. So 5 days ago I arrived in Kathmnadu and reunited with Kailash, it's surreal being back and  have brought the funds raised, I have brought camera equipment to document my attempt at opening a stall for kailash. I will use film studies to document this whole project and create a documentary with themes such as giving, hope, compassion and what it really means to be human. After being here for 5 days I realise this what I'm supposed to do. Before leaving Australia, my dad tried to comity suicide and I had to help him and check him into a psychiatric ward as he had severe mental break down as my brother is also in a similar state. I tell you this as helping someone in need has almost been my coping mechanism and i feel like I 'get it now'. Yes theory has pushed me to really move into this space.  I thank you guys 😊  please feel free to follow me on instagram I'm @c_o_o_l_n_e_i_g_h_b_o_u_r  you can search with out the underscores and I'll appear. Also please take the time to watch the video  created before i left attached to my go fund me page https://gofund.me/b21efd49.  I thank you from the bottom of my heart if you got this far down.

1111,Oggwexbb_ec,"After watching this video, I want to share my story. I have ADHD, all my life I have always felt out of place, and not able to feel like I have been able to find myself. I want to work hard and be who I want to be. I have a unique talent in many things as I am artistic.
I want to finish college, build a business, and overcome my anxiety of talking to people on the phone and in person. I know I can do more, because I did things people thought I would never be able to get through, but I did."
1112,Oggwexbb_ec,"I really appreciate your talks about ADHD. Only at 30 years old, I was properly diagnosed. Medication helped but wasn't a cure for it. ADHD has helped me dive into so many things that most people would skim over. I'd like to be normal. On the other hand, I'm glad I'm not."
1113,Oggwexbb_ec,"This is me , I’ve always thought there was something wrong with me and I even made a comment to my friend a few weeks ago saying to her I think I have adhd, btw I’m 40 years old ,"
1114,Oggwexbb_ec,"Here I thought this was going to be something that mattered. Nope, just another ad."
1115,Oggwexbb_ec,wow holy s*** this video was not worth it's 5 seconds of attention. you basicly just told us that you and your mate have learning disabilities while promoting his company. this is an ad
1116,Oggwexbb_ec,"I really love this video, all my life I've never felt like I fit in, with both my ADHD and social anxiety disorder effecting how I approach every aspect of my life, and never allowing me to have the mental ability to do what I want most, which is to be creative. I've always struggled with creativity, and throughout school I've always done horrible in any art class I had, yet I've always excelled in math classes, and in my junior year of highschool, my algebra 2 teacher was, to say the least, not much of a teacher, which actually led to me pretty much teaching myself the entire class, which actually gave me a better understanding of mathematics than any class previous, and allowed me to realize how I can be creative and create a form of art while having a brain that can only comprehend things which are given to me in formulas which I have to follow EXACTLY to be able to be ""creative"". The art form I discovered I can use formulas in to create unique pieces of art would be photography, and actually, after discovering the yes theory channel during my senior year in which I was also taking a beginner class on photography, I learned more about myself and where I fit in in the world. My place is everywhere, I will never really settle down in life and I will follow my passion for photography around the world, despite my anxiety on meeting new people and devoting my life to something that could potentially fall apart, I really feel like yes theory taught me that despite a rough and uncomfortable journey, if the destination is something you really want, then you can and will get there in the end, all you have to do is ""seek discomfort."""
1117,Oggwexbb_ec,You should do an episode exploring ADHD and different forms of it… it would be nice to see how different people cope with their mental health.
1118,Oggwexbb_ec,"My little girl was diagnosed with ADHD she’s only 6 and does have sever ADHD. Temper tantrums, mood swings, extreme emotions and hyper focused while not being able to focus on anything it’s so hard on her and I can tell. It’s hard to parent her because sometimes I don’t know what to do. I do think the system is broken. My girl has so much potential within her and so much motivation but sometimes we don’t know how to accommodate her needs❤️"
1119,Oggwexbb_ec,💚Yes.  I have something to say.
1120,Oggwexbb_ec,I wouldn't wish ADHD on my worst enemy i can relate to this so hard
1121,Oggwexbb_ec,Bro the animation
1122,Oggwexbb_ec,This is very similar to my story and that is why I'm becoming a special education teacher to try and actually change the system
1123,Oggwexbb_ec,"this feels like my life except i was on med from my 8th till my 16th and i feel like that has fucked me up forgood cuz i have never actually learned how to study, focus or deal with anything and my severe adhd is so overwhelming, but id rather feel like this than a robot zombie"
1124,Oggwexbb_ec,Adhd is a joke I laughed when they said I have something wrong with me I asked you sure it's not my teacher suggesting thees tests and never took my pills unless they were force-fed to me only happened once and then I was schooled in the world
1125,Oggwexbb_ec,"I feeeel this so much Ammar- everyone around me said I would do better on medication and I did take it in high school and it helped me get through it - but as I became an adult - I realised - it was changing who I was. It subdued me, made me less energetic, funny and I took less risks, didn’t put myself out there - so I stopped. Best decision ever! Now I work in schools supporting with kids with adhd and other learning difficulties to help them learn in a way that works for their brains! If I could, obviously I’d love to be travelling the world with yes theory connect with others, but this career is pretty up there - I wish I had someone like me and my co-workers when I was younger :)"
1126,Oggwexbb_ec,Thankyou  so much I have a 17-year-old son with ADHD on medication Struggling a lot Thank you will follow
1127,Oggwexbb_ec,"Cliffs app helped me finish my bachelors. I had never been able to read and learn from a textbook because of my ADHD. When Covid started and I had to finish my last two years still, everything switched to online. My professors relied heavily on textbooks and I thought I was doomed. Once I found Speechify my world flipped upside open for the better. I could finally listen and learn while cleaning my house and cooking dinner. Being able to keep my body busy with various tasks at once while studying kept my brain focused. I started getting straight A’s for the first time in my life."
1128,Oggwexbb_ec,"i have never been of my meds, i want to get off, but it hurts"
1129,Oggwexbb_ec,Wow honestly feel like i have adhd
1130,Oggwexbb_ec,That is why drink only decaf coffee

1133,Nt4zyxLw5hY,Eric and Tom duo is so funny😂😂😂
1134,Nt4zyxLw5hY,0:26 do nada o hino do Brasil kkkkkkk
1135,Nt4zyxLw5hY,omg omg omg. during eric’s list of ideas he said fancy porta potty business. i literally had the same idea. to do like a composting toilet for sustainability and have robot arms that spray disinfectant after each person leaves. and it’s made out of bamboo instead of plastic. crazy he had the same idea. i wonder who else has thought of this.
1136,Nt4zyxLw5hY,update: they're now neomarxist lunatics
1137,Nt4zyxLw5hY,"12:52 the friking camera on their faces xD
That made me laugh wayy too much..."
1138,Nt4zyxLw5hY,"I went to college and was very much one of the people who was mostly concerned with the marks. Thanks to that, even tho I was in the program of my dreams I was always beating myself up and struggled mentally with not feeling good enough. Now that I’m graduated and have a job in my field and can see things through a different lens, I would recommend to anyone in college to worry more about the journey, to listen to the lessons for the hope of learning something new and putting less stress on themselves to just always get the best mark. Hell, I would even say do your projects selectively. Got a project worth 3% but you’re tired? Go to bed. You really only need a pass in the end, because MOST jobs will not ever ask for your marks and you’ll learn most of what you really need on the job"
1139,Nt4zyxLw5hY,"Now go to a HBCU😅😂😂😂u got the PWI life, its only right u visit Howard, Hampton, Clark Atlanta or sum😂😂"

1143,Nt4zyxLw5hY,a really loud keyboard. lol!
1144,Nt4zyxLw5hY,"I'm actually feeling very proud of being a black sheep and dropped out of school and society as a whole, I think that it can be very beneficial not to be enrolled in the dogma of life and just enjoying your life as it is"
1145,Nt4zyxLw5hY,Tommy and Eric is the funniest duo 😂🤩
1146,Nt4zyxLw5hY,Those were some legit ideas
1147,Nt4zyxLw5hY,"I studied hard during my undergrad because I studied in a smaller town with nothing to do. For my masters degree I went to a bigger university and I decided that I will be having the time of my life. I joined a few societies, went out, went to a society trip abroad, partied, definitely did not do as well as I could but at the end of the master year I definitely had lived as I hoped and had no regrets. At the end of the day it is not so serious even if you fail a course or two, you can do it and it is going to be the best time of your life."
1148,Nt4zyxLw5hY,I want that game spark

1172,9jwQI_YYRXE,"These videos have been so interesting and insightful.
Something that struck me was that Ammar knew he was spending 4 nights in the dark, therefore he settled, battled ,and came to the Absolute conclusion that Light and Shadow are part of the same experience... Yet Thomas, knowing he was only in there for 24 hours spent most of his time in 'waiting to get out' ! 
How apt are both of these experiences for us in life? Sometimes in the moment, sometimes waiting to get out..
The Human brain is incredible.. our thoughts create our reality, we seem to be always expecting the next thing, yet All there is , in Now..
A wise person told me Now Here , is nowhere

Great experiences you guys, I am in a darkness of sorts right now, and came to the same conclusions.. 
The shadow only exists because there is something in the path of the light.. in our case, it is ourselves. Both exist. For the scientists out there that should make sense too.. Duality and perception.
Wow, really loved this, thank you 🌈
Love you all ❤"
1173,9jwQI_YYRXE,"Hey guys, what's the name of the retreat center and where is it situated?"
1174,9jwQI_YYRXE,Where is this place?
1175,9jwQI_YYRXE,For a second I thought this would be incredible thing to look into... and then I remembered I have intense derealization episodes and that it'd be so irresponsiible of me to put myself in that kinda risk lmao. I'll just be fascinated from a distance
1176,9jwQI_YYRXE,"I don't love seek discomfort because of where you've come from, I love it because of where you're going ❤️ Changing the world 1 video at a time"
1177,9jwQI_YYRXE,"i wouldn't be able to survive more than 24 hours , I am kind of afraid of total darkness , I would feel like claustrophobic...still I would love to have the experience"
1178,9jwQI_YYRXE,how do you go to the toilet here
1179,9jwQI_YYRXE,I love this!
1180,9jwQI_YYRXE,"Want a dayoff of complete rest?

1181,9jwQI_YYRXE,They have a genuine friendship so happy to see that in today's world  💚
1182,9jwQI_YYRXE,Amazing
1183,9jwQI_YYRXE,This is only like 5 hours from my house!! This is probably the most uncomfortable I could make myself.
1184,9jwQI_YYRXE,"Also , not trying to spam by leaving several comments XD *I just thought that you could find it interesting to both go in a center in india  to do a vipassana retread of several days in meditations* (they're everywhere in the world, but india would be cool^^) See what happens to you and your consciousness ""level"" after doing several days straight of meditations like that. I would love to see! =)"
1185,9jwQI_YYRXE,"Also realizing that Ammar, you manage to let go of the human habit of ""waiting for the next moment to come"" after 5 days, but in one day, Thomas, you still couldn't and kept waiting for someone to come, or waiting for the next thing/the end of the experience. So in 24h it seems harder to go into a ""total surrender to the present moment"" like Eckhart Tolle would call it. 
I wonder how I would feel like. I've had periods of my life where I was meditating several hours straight everyday and after a while, weird things started happening to me as a results^^ So I kind of know what it's like to fully surrender, but In the dark with still the moment where someone comes to give you food that is kind of giving you an idea of the passing time...i don't know how I would react after 5 full days.
 Thank you so much for those videos. It makes me want to meditated more once again =) Love you guys!"
1186,9jwQI_YYRXE,Where is this pleace?
1187,9jwQI_YYRXE,Amar seems like he really decompressed in that room. The tone of his voice tells me he’s found a new kind of peace. Idk
1188,9jwQI_YYRXE,These people at Yes Theory are legendary.
1189,9jwQI_YYRXE,Ammar always makes it look easy

1214,572wvSyRBf8,The a art is just so mesmerizing 😊
1215,572wvSyRBf8,Amazing! I mean how huge my smile is.

Must be so surreal in there
Thanks for the tour"
1217,572wvSyRBf8,The future is FEMALE
1218,572wvSyRBf8,"I agree that there is a ton wrong with Dubai and that part of the world. But I think comment section is overthinking YT intentions. Ammar just wanted to document and share some cool buildings and museums that he saw. And it is certainly unfortunate that they were built by slaves, but he was obviously not trying to promote slavery"

1233,b0il2IsU1f0,Loved this video!! One of my favorites! Such a fun idea!
1234,b0il2IsU1f0,Their pronunciation of the towns are so funny. It's like a little game trying to guess what they're referring to if you're Irish.
1235,b0il2IsU1f0,This makes me want to hitchhike
1236,b0il2IsU1f0,So heartwarming that a woman can safely pick up two strangers with out any fear ❤️
1237,b0il2IsU1f0,"Hi everyoneI I loved the idea of this video for a race. I have hitched hitchhiked Canada coast to coast 3 times. But this video does not even compare to the ""disconfort"" that I have been through. I would love to see a more challenging hitch hiking video. Just to get out of you comfort zone that much more. I love your guys work, and keep up the GREAT JOB! I hear your philosohpy. In my opinion, you can do a better hittck hiking video then the one that was posted. I did not mean to offend anyinw with the lack of expirenece..."
1238,b0il2IsU1f0,Her name in Ukrainian is vika I can’t do the correct translation but I learned that from some Ukrainians I met on a cruise and they were lovely
1239,b0il2IsU1f0,"""I bet they're not having an amazing experience. Nah, they're not....""

""BRR-BR-BRRAAAAP!"""
1240,b0il2IsU1f0,I would do this in a heartbeat = I have been dying to visit Ireland where my family is from.  Doing this would be a dream!!!  I am teary=eyed right now
1241,b0il2IsU1f0,"""Nobody's gonna turn down this smile"" coming from Bryce is the most correct thing I've heard"
1242,b0il2IsU1f0,"Please do more Irish videos because I would love to bump into you guys! I’m a Scuba Diver, Rock Climbing instructor, Martial Artist and Irish Stunt professional 😁 would love to show you a crazy adventure! 💚"
1243,b0il2IsU1f0,Cam is the best😂
1244,b0il2IsU1f0,"I have never seen any video that embodies ""It's about the friends we made along the way"" more than this one. Who tf cares who won in the end lol! Also, all the best to Victoria, Anna and her husband"
1245,b0il2IsU1f0,"“i bet they’re not having an amazing experience”

hops on a motorcycle with a motocross cyclist and shoots guns"
1246,b0il2IsU1f0,"I stayed in a cabin just down the road to the left of the castle @4:35 for our wedding!

That castle is known as ""the castle of goats"" if I remember correctly."
1247,b0il2IsU1f0,I wanna see a Yes Theory vs Wendover Productions travel race around the world.
1248,b0il2IsU1f0,"I had to double-take where Gabriella picked them up, I could've bumped into the lads back then"
1249,b0il2IsU1f0,...they got picked up by the king of ireland...

1271,V7oPEt67gOM,what is the watch that Anders is wearing? Is it Garmin?
1272,V7oPEt67gOM,2023 - NFTs ☠ Crypto almost ☠
1273,V7oPEt67gOM,"I just watched Project Iceman, and it was amazing. What’s funny is these comments saying “NFT’s are the wrong way to go”, but the whole movie is designed around the haters. You can’t do this and you can’t do that. Maybe NFT’s weren’t the perfect answer, but neither you or I have experience in releasing a film so how about let’s just let ordinary people do extraordinary things."
1274,V7oPEt67gOM,"You guys seem to have gone against your morals on this one. I still cant watch the doc,,,,"
1275,V7oPEt67gOM,This is the worst yes theory video ever sorry
1276,V7oPEt67gOM,Hi! Quick question: wasn't the documentary be available on YouTube at the end of the year 2022?
1277,V7oPEt67gOM,nft? LOL
1278,V7oPEt67gOM,"I use to feel inspired by yes theory, but after seeing this I'm just so disappointed"
1279,V7oPEt67gOM,I am one of those who found you through Wim Hoff and I am so grateful for it! You are so inspiring and I am so excited to watch this!
1280,V7oPEt67gOM,Just don't
1281,V7oPEt67gOM,I’ll buy a shirt instead
1282,V7oPEt67gOM,Is there any options like a pay preview for us to watch from home being I live in hawaii and nothing ever comes here
1283,V7oPEt67gOM,"I was really excited to hear this announcement.. But then I heard NFT. Which the system that was stated at the beginning of the video just comes off as a complicated and round about way to say that you bought a hard copy of your favorite movie from Walmart. I'm gonna be real, this comment is being made a few months later (9/20/22) and without doing any research, I have doubts that its really even working. And also the fact that you are losing money and possibly even thousands of customers if you were just to use a normal system. Why couldn't we use the receipt system? I don't understand that, you are buying a copy of the film, but then you have the financial security and guarantee of the receipt. You aren't buy a license to use or watch it. The NFT system is unstable, unpredictable, and the word NFT itself drives people away. You can't guarantee the fanatical security with a system that relies off of others to also buy into it. Like I said going back to the Walmart analogy, you would own a digital copy of it, and if something were to happen to it, that receipt guarantees that you can get it back. Putting the future of your whole brand on the reliability of people to always spend money on something that is basically worthless doesn't seem smart. Crowd founding or just selling it as a regular product on your website would most likely get you more support and money out of it, to fund future expeditions. I may not fully understand NFT's, but they have made a bad name for themselves for a reason. I would feel safer putting my money on a crowd founding campaign, or just buying a copy than this round about way."
1284,V7oPEt67gOM,"The only thing you said about nfts are that it will replace the digital footprint of 3 emails. But you didn’t really explain why they’re a good idea for crowdfunding at all. It’s so confusing because you can tell your audience wants to support you but you didn’t answer any questions. It seems like this will be a big project for you guys, but also that it will isolate the majority of your fan base. Not really sure how to feel. I know a lot about nfts tbh and they are essentially the modern way of filtering money through the art market untaxed and untraced. But it sucks that you guys didn’t represent a way that this helps your audience and I believe it’s because you know it doesn’t 😅 nfts and crypto still has a horrible carbon footprint obviously because of energy. I kindaaaa get why you guys are doing it this way but it’s cause I know it’s more beneficial for you guys financially which is fine. You should be honest about that though."
1285,V7oPEt67gOM,"I just came back and checked the dislikes. Yeesh, you guys really got a lot of backlash.
I just thought I'd comment again to say that I'm enjoying my NFT. I have no intention to sell it, ever. I never thought anyone would even want to buy it. I'm simply glad to support a project I believe in, and get a neat looking digital collectible in return.
It's like an achievement badge I can keep forever, that shows I was part of helping this become possible, even in a small way. Can't wait for the release!"
1286,V7oPEt67gOM,16k dislikes wow you guys just stained your reputation
1287,V7oPEt67gOM,cringe
1288,V7oPEt67gOM,ohhh boy ..you guys felt for this environmental bullshit regarding blockchains. you do have a lot of catch up to do :)
1289,V7oPEt67gOM,"NFTs are terrible for the environment because of their insane electricity consumption. for a channel that frequently travels the world for content, you could at least do your part so that the world and its beauty can continue to exist."
1290,V7oPEt67gOM,"NFTs are a scam, nothing more nothing less. Sad, sad sad sad to see you take this road.
And one last thing. Don't you see what is going on in the world? How corrupt everything is and that our governments don't care about us? Poor people getting poorer and rich people getting richer (and controlling every part of our lives).
I part of that BS is ""NFTs"" so you are participating in all of the above I wrote."
1291,86rK9Tqpxww,Thank you for having helped to inspire me with the badassness to turn down corporate money :)
1292,86rK9Tqpxww,I love this so much.
1293,86rK9Tqpxww,"Your inspiration, lot more than $."
1294,86rK9Tqpxww,"If you said yes you wouldn't be where you are today, and today if you need that money you sure are thinking about I.T.   Paying your own weight."
1295,86rK9Tqpxww,"I just want to let you guys know my name is Ameera Ziane Boyd, the group of you men has inspired me in so many ways, The courage , the unity you guys share together is amazing, the way you guys push through your ""fears"" and accomplish everything just empowers the world and more importantly myself. You guys gave me the courage to become sober i have became sober for 375 days and watching you guys pushed me, i remember being up for hours not being able to sleep struggling through withdrawals and the night i wanted to relapse i would put on a yes theory video and ball  crying feeling like i had no control then while i would watch each video somewhere throughout each and every video i would find a gem and push forward. You guys mean the world to me you guys don't even no i appreciate all the time and effort you guys put in your videos so we can few the world and find purpose within ourself i love you guy and i just want to say im beyond thankful <3"
1296,86rK9Tqpxww,u probably should have said yes the movie sucked

1298,86rK9Tqpxww,"Im inspired what you have achieved on this project, I can’t wait for the premiere. Just watching the trailer unlocked so many suppressed emotions that I had and now I’m learning to open up and face them"
1299,86rK9Tqpxww,Watching your channel makes me smile bro. Thank you
1300,86rK9Tqpxww,I have followed you guys now since the start of Yes Theory 7 years ago. You guys still amaze me with your content.
1301,86rK9Tqpxww,"you guys are awesome, ive struggled with aspergers all my life so my anxiety levels are always bad meaning i rarely go out. my whole life is discomfort but i jUst cant seems to face the fear of strangers and the unknown, whch means i am missing so much life.

1303,86rK9Tqpxww,👏👏👏
1304,86rK9Tqpxww,"I've been in a dark place recently and what ice man saying about you guys sharing what you have is so important is so true, you guys have helped me turn my life around over the last few weeks, I cannot thank you enough. I am truly seeking discomfort, thanks to you."
1305,86rK9Tqpxww,I NEED TO SEE THIS FILM!

1312,FNoT5aLSMqI,I’m happy for you Tommy!!! This is truly connecting to strangers.!!
1313,FNoT5aLSMqI,Dude if he had a connecting flight he could have just bought the ticket to Panama which is even further away
1314,FNoT5aLSMqI,Eric cheated and bought a plane ticket to Hawaii when he told the guy going to Las Vegas that the challenge was to get someone to buy a plane ticket for the same destination. So Tommy wins because Eric is disqualified
1315,FNoT5aLSMqI,"Tommy's trip was really meaningful and I honestly feel like his trip was my favorite just because of that. Eric's was showy and fun and all, but it just didn't have the depth of Tommy's."
1316,FNoT5aLSMqI,Good evening laties and gentlemen “Why even make an announcement?” So salty 🤣
1317,FNoT5aLSMqI,"the time when they mention your contry :D, QUE VIVA PANAMÁ"

1320,FNoT5aLSMqI,💚
1321,FNoT5aLSMqI,"Ha ha ha I flew to Costa Rica from Canada 2 years ago alone. I thought i was staying for 3 months. I just discovered Yes Theory last week. And I have been dreaming to go back to Hawaii as I watched these flight challenge clips. No way the two places so deeply embedded in my heart.  I have many times asked life where it wants me to go and point blank put my finger down on a map and then went there. I am an artist and I made art in those places - I'm just celebrating my 60th birthday on Sunday - thanks for sharing the thrill guys. In the old days with no cell phones and no google maps - I used my intuition and trusted all my instincts,"
1322,FNoT5aLSMqI,tommys journey was about the people and for the people ❤
1323,FNoT5aLSMqI,"I think it's a draw.  Both engaged with the people who live in the places that they visited, and they created interesting videos that made one  keep watching."
1324,FNoT5aLSMqI,"Wat cameras do you use during these kinds of trips and the ""Survive 24 hours with no money"" is it still the same medium size ones or is it a smaller GoPro like camera."
1325,FNoT5aLSMqI,"They are both winners - for we are all different and will approach the Yes Theory in different ways.  We will all seek discomfort in different ways.  There is no one shoe fits all.  Eric - based on his outgoing nature -  was able to accomplish the feat very fast and link up with strangers in Hawaii.  Thomas - based on his more introverted nature -  struggled in the beginning, but was able to link up with the Yes Fam in Costa Rica which I feel meant A LOT to them.  And this is what makes this group interesting - we are all different and approach things in different ways, but when we pull our resources and talents together, we come up with something great."
1326,FNoT5aLSMqI,7:00
1327,FNoT5aLSMqI,Tommy ur reenactment editing is fucking amazing!!
1328,FNoT5aLSMqI,The end of this video is definitely the best 🤣. Awesome actors 👍
1329,FNoT5aLSMqI,Eric had the best trip 😂
1330,FNoT5aLSMqI,7:16 they got issues? or they got these shoes xd

1383,9jrYdUGxFv4,"I wish I could fly like that!! For as long as I've been aware of bungee jumping, skydiving, & activities such as hang gliding, that's been a far-fetched dream bc I've had 8 thoracic surgeries/2 total chestwall reconstruction operations & I've been told, ""The force to the chestwall is too dangerous."" I think it's that no 1 wants to risk the liability, & I pray someone will say, ""We can do this, you can skydive bc our harnesses are designed so your trunk (bottom) takes the majority of impact."" For now, I watch these videos to support the movement... & maybe feel slightly jealous each time someone takes bodily discomfort w/a smile & appreciation for life bc I've always been in a prison body & haven't really felt very alive."

1462,lVPTUMlOugY,Good luck Ammar 😊
1463,lVPTUMlOugY,This is so great!!!
1464,lVPTUMlOugY,Many people think that these “golden passport” programs are somehow sketchy or disingenuous and only used by rich people to evade taxes and other social responsibilities.  Those people need to watch this video.
1465,lVPTUMlOugY,i can only hope that i ever find friends half as awesome as you guys are for each other. you guys are more than inspiring. you are helping me heal and helping me see what beautiful friendships look like. thank you so much. love you guys.

1469,lVPTUMlOugY,Congratulations Ammar. You guys rock! ❤
1470,lVPTUMlOugY,So so glad to see him get what he deserves!!!

1472,sfxJn8ML6g4,this pool is made by sl*ves for osama bin ladins construction LLC
1473,sfxJn8ML6g4,Wasnt this pool constructed using slave labour by the Bin Laden construction family and paid for with blood money? Doesnt seem very Yes Theory to me but i guess everyone has a price...
1474,sfxJn8ML6g4,"just so everyone knows, they probably got paid to do this and the construction company who owns it is BIN LADENS construction company, let that sink in lol"
1475,sfxJn8ML6g4,With everything going on and considering the slavery and abuse of people in Dubai and them not standing with Palestine 🇵🇸 you should delete this video
1476,sfxJn8ML6g4,Why do you support terrorists?
1477,sfxJn8ML6g4,"Wow, supporting terrorist. Nice."
1478,sfxJn8ML6g4,This is owned by the Bin Laden family….
1479,sfxJn8ML6g4,"WOW a lot to unpack here:
So you went to a country and city known for being built and maintained by literal slaves.
Controlled by men who are known for human trafficking and the ""Dubai porta potty""
Then you accepted money to promote a state-run swimming pool, that was literally built by OSAMA BIN LADEN'S FAMILY COMPANY (now owned by the prince).

I always liked you but you really really dropped the ball on this one."
1480,sfxJn8ML6g4,"A pool built by the Bin Laden family and slavery? Sign these guys up, I guess."
1481,sfxJn8ML6g4,fun fact: did you know this place was built by Osama Binladens family construction company? oh and they used slaves...
1482,sfxJn8ML6g4,"Hm this video is so good and I’m not suspecting anyone here of maybe receiving something in return for this video, this thing would certainly never be currency, in large amounts"
1483,sfxJn8ML6g4,Astronaut in the ocean
1484,sfxJn8ML6g4,cool
1485,sfxJn8ML6g4,sick looks sooo cool but theres no way id ever pay $550 new zealand dollars [the currency id have to save] thats a propper rich cunt holiday lol
1486,sfxJn8ML6g4,Every submarine
1487,sfxJn8ML6g4,Cost ?
1488,sfxJn8ML6g4,That locker design?Just why?
1489,sfxJn8ML6g4,"This is a real smart idea but technically very risky. This is a huge place, very easy to have accidents and shut the place or increase bad reputation"
1490,sfxJn8ML6g4,I would go to Dubai just to do this. 😮
1491,Da0J9pnPaIY,Hi friends! We made a spelling mistake in the video writing “Cypress” instead of “Cyprus”. Although we review our videos endless amounts of times before publishing sometimes mistakes make it through! We’re sorry about that and we hope you enjoyed the video!! 🙏
1492,Da0J9pnPaIY,My grandads ashes are scattered on the exact cliff jump spot. I have also jumped off the same ledge. Man I love Cyprus so much
1493,Da0J9pnPaIY,I have facing this fear probably thousands times for almost 21-22 years. I am PhD student now and still afraid of exams. What can I do? 😀
1494,Da0J9pnPaIY,Does anyone know the song at 0:50?
1495,Da0J9pnPaIY,"Im so scared of heights too, would love to do something like this to overcome it, even though I'd be so so scared."
1496,Da0J9pnPaIY,I'm 30y.o and I still don't know how yo swim :(
1497,Da0J9pnPaIY,The little drop sound effect at 3:03 was savage
1498,Da0J9pnPaIY,Cyprus was a beautiful place and got the guaba tattoo to remember it by lol
1499,Da0J9pnPaIY,Denmarks national song at 2:31 isn’t it?☺️
1500,Da0J9pnPaIY,I wanna go cliff jumping now :/
1501,Da0J9pnPaIY,"I can relate 
I myself am scared of heights and just because of that I almost passed on going on a skydiving trip with my wife and friends I am so glad I didn’t let that fear over come me and now I’m still scared but it really makes u feel like u can face anything once you face once of your fears"
1502,Da0J9pnPaIY,NATHANIEL DREW ‼️💪🏼
1503,Da0J9pnPaIY,He’s too scared to be part of the crew
1504,Da0J9pnPaIY,I jumped from height of 10 meters suddenly when a mad monkey was chasing me. 😅
1505,Da0J9pnPaIY,Johnny!!! Ehhhhh
1506,Da0J9pnPaIY,HA! I love at 2:37 the music is the danish national anthem
1507,Da0J9pnPaIY,The camera probably doesn’t do it justice. Probably looks like a mile high when your up there haha.
1508,Da0J9pnPaIY,@3:02 the water droplet sound was hilarious 😆
1509,Da0J9pnPaIY,that is so wholesome! I mean literally i needed courage now. Thank you for making the wolrd a better place brothers
1510,Da0J9pnPaIY,Yey!! He jumped #seek discomfort

1522,msesln6r3Lo,I am so envious of some of the things you guys do that balloon ride looked absolutely awesome.
1523,msesln6r3Lo,This looks like so much fun! Cappadocia looks so beautiful!
1524,msesln6r3Lo,You guys are amazing filmmakers. Your journey is powerful. And oh boy the documentaries have been so inspiring. I'll make a comment when I revisit the iceman video. But my shivers went away cuz of the breathing I'm cold showers. :)

1526,msesln6r3Lo,EPIC!!!

1530,msesln6r3Lo,The hot air balloon ride was amazing! I did it in Gold coast Australia but this landscape was astoundingly beautiful!!

1535,9ujwPrXlb7E,Eric is so handsome for his new haircut and new shave.
1536,9ujwPrXlb7E,Come and do abandoned in Malaysia!
1537,9ujwPrXlb7E,Cem is what we call in Germany... Ehrenmann. Man of Honor.
1538,9ujwPrXlb7E,"People can be so generous, no matter what country you may visit. Although, I'm not sure about the 'Freddie Mercury' look, from the barber?"
1539,9ujwPrXlb7E,It would have been a lot more interesting to seek discomfort adding to the challenge the goal of making money to pay your own meals and lodge without accepting anything for free.
1540,9ujwPrXlb7E,2:52 you said something very important. Your grandparents went straight to work.
1541,9ujwPrXlb7E,"I've binged watched your channel today and I love it! However, I feel like it would be impossible to do a challenge like this as a girl. Like the safety element which is unfortunate but it is the world we live in. I would love to try it and be proved wrong but I'm unsure how it would be done. You probably won't see this comment but I think it is something to think about."
1542,9ujwPrXlb7E,7:37 why are there romanian money on the table?
1543,9ujwPrXlb7E,They should do an abandoned in Sweden next 🙌
1544,9ujwPrXlb7E,I can't stop laughing at his moustache!
1545,9ujwPrXlb7E,"10:11 You should've just went in a restaurant and asked them, I think you'd have easily found a better place to spend a penny, I'm Turkish btw, and I'm a professional at this stuff."
1546,9ujwPrXlb7E,Jesus loves you
1547,9ujwPrXlb7E,serefe!
1548,9ujwPrXlb7E,You cant do this in the US for sure 😅
1549,9ujwPrXlb7E,I need to go back to this episode to propose that you need to give back to persons who help you here.
1550,9ujwPrXlb7E,Ι feel that it's not any difficult for them from the moment that they convince someone to have a look at the Yes Theory channel on Youtube.  The challenge is supposed to be valid under the condition of no playing the Yes Theory card.
1551,qmVNSKTiXj8,Maybe if derin wont leave yes theory maybe he is also a billionaire right now
1552,qmVNSKTiXj8,"Rewatching this video and crying seeing Derin and seeing Matt meeting him too recently, feels great they've not forgotten him."

1559,qmVNSKTiXj8,The way Derin keeps hugging Ammar 🥺❤️

1572,osfDwb9Uc0I,"Wow. I’ve heard a lot of terrible things about the Amish, and although I’m one to look more on the bright side, this is something that took me off guard completely. It was super refreshing to see people happy with what they had and not looking to see the next thing in the future. It was super surprising to hear they watch YouTube. Along with the washer and dryer too. I honestly imagined that their home would be a little more last century too. Really nice video, lots of good people on it. 😂 hopefully."
1573,osfDwb9Uc0I,"Still one of the most amazing things that I ever heard was when that guy wemt to the school house and killed their children and then himself. They said that they forgave him and went to his funeral.  They said something along the lines of, his wife lost someone too."
1574,osfDwb9Uc0I,"What a experience!!!  It is so nice to see young people like you interested in other's people culture and life style. Also, how amazing this Amish family have taken you in their home!  WOW! So uplifting. Congratulations guys! you NAILED it!"
1575,osfDwb9Uc0I,"Its not the fact they are stuck living in the past, but rather were the ones stuck trying to live in the future."
1576,osfDwb9Uc0I,"He almost won that game, 63-68."
1577,osfDwb9Uc0I,“Do you know what brooms are?” 😂😂😂 that got me lol
1578,osfDwb9Uc0I,"all that driving while filming makes me anxious!  Also, I love this family, they are so kind.  I love when he asked you guys if you know what brooms are. 😆"
1579,osfDwb9Uc0I,amazing video
1580,osfDwb9Uc0I,"Why does it seem you're making a mockery of the Amish rather than being serious about how they live? I can't support a channel that takes advantage of people to achieve fame. Cracking jokes at them, the rap music walking into target... Had to stop the video right there cause I caught onto what you're doing. Should be ashamed of yourself. And that family you visited should be ashamed of themselves as well for going against their religion they claim to be devoted too. Now I see why the Amish are so limited to who they invite into their community. People like you are wolves in sheep's clothing. Hope other members of YouTube see this stop supporting fake people such as yourself. I may seem like I'm coming off a little to harsh and heavy but that's because I am. These people have worked hard for 100s of years to keep to their roots and humble beginnings and they also fight to protect themselves people such as you that come in like a snake putting on a fake smile and friendly vibes but really tricking them so you can bring more attention to your channel and gain views for money. Very distasteful"
1581,osfDwb9Uc0I,that dude was on buzz feed too! whats his name? (green seek discomfort sweater) I d like to see more of him
1582,osfDwb9Uc0I,GODS CARPENTERS DO THE AMISH STILL GO BY MATTHEW 5 5 AND 1PETER 5 5
1583,osfDwb9Uc0I,I wonder what amish people think about flat earth?
1584,osfDwb9Uc0I,If they have guns to protect themselves they already really on outside world. This is bs 😂😂
1585,osfDwb9Uc0I,"Technology. I have no one probably 16 to 20 Amish people in my life, and not a single one rejected technology, it was just secret that they used it"
1586,osfDwb9Uc0I,They should make a new video of them going back to bring the Amish guy to LA.
1587,osfDwb9Uc0I,What a awesome video
1588,osfDwb9Uc0I,The speech the man said in the back seat was something truly beautiful
1589,osfDwb9Uc0I,A horse and buggy is some of the best technology of its time!
1590,osfDwb9Uc0I,Great video. Amazing family!
1591,J13aRi1rhms,"If a band is cohesive, can make good music, and really play their instruments and sing, then it's a real band. If it were by your description not a real band, then that would mean that no band is real😂"

1593,J13aRi1rhms,"Anyone remember ""Dregs of Humanity"" from It's Your Move?"
1594,J13aRi1rhms,"Hands down the best yes theory or seek discomfort video I’ve watched, not too produced, just honest and entertaining. Would love more like this!"
1595,J13aRi1rhms,Would love to see yes theory explore hardcore punk metal music scene.
1596,J13aRi1rhms,I'm still listening to them!
1597,J13aRi1rhms,"I wonder if there was a valid reason to decide to edit the video with a track recorded in studio, instead of using original audio from the beginning of the concert, without superimposing another track out of sync with the images. Maybe live recording had gone wrong?"
1598,J13aRi1rhms,"what a talented guy. he is a pro athlete, insane musician, original songwriter, and professional editor????!!!!!!"
1599,J13aRi1rhms,Sorry to be a downer but literally ANY band can play at the Whiskey. Its PAY TO PLAY. Go play the Silverlake Lounge instead.
1600,J13aRi1rhms,I never would have expected this nerdy guy to be a rock star
1601,J13aRi1rhms,💚

1603,J13aRi1rhms,Yes!
1604,J13aRi1rhms,This was awesooome! This is why i love yes theory!!!
1605,J13aRi1rhms,Anyone else think Tristan is just the most adorable brilliant guy ?? It’s so refreshing to see a passionate man who’s not afraid to be himself <3
1606,J13aRi1rhms,"Tristian this is fucking awesome, i'm so jealous especailly cause I work at a bar but they wont let me play there lol :( 

Buuuut also AMMAR! You're a gangsta, you're living like a king and creating a beautiful thing for your friends and so many others, keep living an awesome life and help your friends move fowards"
1607,J13aRi1rhms,"lollll classic procals. When the local opener rolls up to the gig with a larger vehicle than the headliner and brings all their friends and cameras, tries to take up the entire greenroom and has way too much unnecessary equipment on stage. To top it off, with freshly printed scrims blocking all of it anyway.  The pro musicians, on the other hand, use exactly what they need, they put on a great show, and then get out of the way. After many times moving equipment around, the extra stuff is really just extra work, and the more stuff you have, the more ways things can go wrong. You end up learning to become a finely tuned machine, rather than a flashy piece.   

Also, the scam of local openers having to sell 100 tickets or can't play. What ends up happening is the band won't be able to sell the tickets, so they'll just buy them out of their own pocket and end up giving them away to friends and family. So the promoter makes out well, and the opener got to spend money to preform in front of a few people early on in the evening. While hoping the national headliner is watching their set, but they're off living their own lives too naturally - having dinner, napping, practicing, just doing whatever until an hour or two before their set. That's the game.


On a different note, this video was fun!! They killed it, everyone had a great time and I'm glad he got to live his dream!"
1608,J13aRi1rhms,THE OUTRO HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
1609,J13aRi1rhms,aweeee

1614,vY8S6cGoGCk,"💚 Just sent a message to a friend in Australia who I think would be a great fit with the Yes Family!  She is young, adventurous, a model and actress.  I ran into her in a store and asked if I could look at her braids.  And after finding out she was living in a van and traveling to Zion for a few days.  She and a guy friend stayed at my apartment, I dropped them off at the top of a hike, and hung out.  We'll be forever friends (she actually calls me her other Mum)."

1671,zE2JxgQIw0Y,This looks breathtaking! Would be an absolute dream to do this someday
1672,zE2JxgQIw0Y,Watch people say that Aconcagua is America’s tallest mountain. Yep I was right.
1673,zE2JxgQIw0Y,I am planning to hike from my house (in Colorado Springs) to the top of Pikes Peak... Who's interested?
1674,zE2JxgQIw0Y,Let’s goooo I’m way too down. Bring me next year
1675,zE2JxgQIw0Y,AMMAR doing so many things and good at it.. amazing
1676,zE2JxgQIw0Y,You gotta try Mt. Shavano in Colorado for your next 14er! By far one of the hardest hikes I have done to date!
1677,zE2JxgQIw0Y,Pema is from Tibet she looks chilled
1678,zE2JxgQIw0Y,Shout out to Ammar for keeping a positive attitude after throwing up like that! I would not want to finish the hike lol
1679,zE2JxgQIw0Y,watching this videos make me happy. I very much like to  meet you gusy and do adventure......😍😍😍😍😍
1680,zE2JxgQIw0Y,"Oh shit I love Aaron, it's awesome to see you guys doing a collab😀"
1681,zE2JxgQIw0Y,"Ammar, this is the celebration of your birth. A time to be grateful you were born and are here. Also time to Thank the Mama. Some people give their parents gifts to thank them for all they have given to them. Another way of thinking about our birthdays❣️"

1683,zE2JxgQIw0Y,Wait how long the it take too get to the top?
1684,zE2JxgQIw0Y,I thought the tallest mountain in the USA was in alaska
1685,zE2JxgQIw0Y,Amman is very lucky to have friends who are there for him and cheer him on/up. Maybe it IS because he acts happy vs acts down and out.  I’ve always wondered how people have so many friends .  I’m onboard with what he’s talking about : this year of finding me/ myself. Inside Balance and taking actual Time for it.   “ Find Joy In the Journey” Within . 💕
1686,zE2JxgQIw0Y,"Pema is such a badass!! That tiny woman does some crazy shit I love it ! Her form while hiking really shows she knows what she’s doing, moving so swiftly. & she’s absolutely beautiful too. ❤️ I’m so happy ammar was able to experience this, we know his passion for the cold!!  I love the videos always. And love everyone in them. You guys are great people and make me have hope for the future. 🥹"

1713,h3VGQAY3joM,Such a missed opportunity to not play I'm on a boat
1714,h3VGQAY3joM,Please invite Eric in next year's episode. :) I miss seeing him on your videos.

1717,h3VGQAY3joM,"Omg ur channel is amazing ! I literally just discovered your channel and I’m pretty sure I’ve watch EVERY video that was uploaded! Not even joking !! 

Stay true to yourselves and keep giving off with the positive vibes !!"
1718,h3VGQAY3joM,"i say congrats to the father for trusting his son, as im sure he pleaded the case and his dad was big enough man to change his mind i know my father would see that as admitting he was wrong, unfortunately, hes of the oak school not bamboo"
1719,h3VGQAY3joM,I’m SO happy everyone respected his property and the opportunity!   Oh geez if I was 25 years younger. 😊
1720,h3VGQAY3joM,I love how getting wet is the ultimate deterrent to people trying to trespass on boats lol
1721,h3VGQAY3joM,Helps having a million subscribers lol. We need more challenge lol.
1722,h3VGQAY3joM,The power of if you don’t ask the answer is always no 😮😂
1723,h3VGQAY3joM,"Hopefully youi thought of the girls from the start.  I would probably guess that 99% of the kind of boats you're looking for are owned by rich men.  So a bunch of young guys asking to party on their boats would have gone over like a fart in church.  Some attractive young ladies though, that's a different story."
1724,h3VGQAY3joM,"Your videos always make me cry, no matter how uplifting they are!! I'm such an introvert, with 3 friends, I dont go into stores anymore so if anything can be done online, that's what I do. Your videos just make me so happy to see large groups of like minded people getting together and seeking discomfort. Something I haven't done for a long time."
1725,h3VGQAY3joM,Madddd!!! 💜 Sergios manifestation? Absolutely maddd. This was so fun to watch and be inspired by

1734,bhKQTkGhZ6M,Watching this is 2023 is heartbreaking please do an update on noor and the situation
1735,bhKQTkGhZ6M,"once Afghanistan (Khorasan) was one of mightiest civilization in the world, this is why you can see people with different cultures in here."
1736,bhKQTkGhZ6M,"I'm living in Afghanistan, and it's not dangerous at all. and it was not dangerous in the past."

1739,bhKQTkGhZ6M,"I don’t think I have ever commented on a video but I just want to say I love your videos. I love everything that yes theory stands for. I find my self smiling ear to ear on some videos and crying on others. No matter what you guys do you pour your hearts into and it shows. Especially in todays times where the world just seems scarier and scarier and more divided you show compassion, understanding, empathy and just love. Here’s to seeking more discomfort in 2023 ❤"
1740,bhKQTkGhZ6M,"I really felt so sad when I saw leg pieces of cows..as a Hindu guy i can't see like this..people are so cruel, why they do these things..shame on them"
1741,bhKQTkGhZ6M,I still wonder how different the journey would have been if you were a female?
1742,bhKQTkGhZ6M,All of these afghans dreams were ruined from president Biden.  Glad i was able to fight and serve in Afghanistan.  Met some life long friends there.
1743,bhKQTkGhZ6M,You also have another channel  right?
1744,bhKQTkGhZ6M,"I spent some time there about 20 years ago, the people were awesome and some of the kindest i've ever met."
1745,bhKQTkGhZ6M,"maybe you should go now. the people are content with the situation, because they have the frist time after decades no war. take a look what the drones have done to so much citizens. a lot of them are content now. they are saying, peace has its price, ok, fair enough. even if we maybe cant understand it, while we are thinking our culutre is the best for everyone, its not and tbh our culture of bringing freedom and peace with war, old western colonization style, imho its not the best thing since sliced bread. would be nice to see you there now. saw some documentaries actually and its very impressive.... in every way. take the bad, take the good, but they have peace. probably something we cant understand while we see it only from the distance.....must be ugly to have the feeling, there can be everytime, everywhere a drone and kill you, your children, your whole family only you had the wrong mobile or you was on a family party. i think we cant understand that in our ignorant perspective. especially as an US or EU citizen, which believes, our values must exported to all over the world and everybody has to see it in the same way. we didnt bring prospering to these areas, only war terror, suffer and millions of deaths in the last decades. and they are still friendly to us, when we are visiting. oh man, free your mind, open your heart."
1746,bhKQTkGhZ6M,I hope Nor and his family are ok

1749,bhKQTkGhZ6M,The land of Afghanistan holds the secrets of our ancient past.
1750,bhKQTkGhZ6M,"I want to go to Afghanistan so bad and I’m not even afghani. 

It’s got a ridiculous amount of lost  history. It’s basically the heart of persia. Rumi lived in this region. The afghanis I’ve met in the USA are some of the best humans I’ve ever met. If I had your opportunity, I would’ve done it."
1751,gEdySFWUfkA,Love this ❤
1752,gEdySFWUfkA,Congratulations for getting full licence 🦾 and bringing people to the best way of life ever 🎉
1753,gEdySFWUfkA,Guy's you should relauch the hoodies and Tshirt with this message and some of your old merch!!!
1754,gEdySFWUfkA,13:04 this moment... this priceless moment
1755,gEdySFWUfkA,I would love to work with you guys :)
1756,gEdySFWUfkA,I've been scared of heights all my life. So many times I've felt that fear when my feet froze if I came too close to enywhere I can see really far down. And now bungee jumping is becoming something I'm looking forward to somewhere really nice.
1757,gEdySFWUfkA,"I’m surprised they let you jump tandem out of the hot air balloon! This must have not taken place in the USA.  I don’t think the USPA (United States Parachute Association) would let you do this. (I could be wrong though).  It’s basically a hop and pop (meaning jumping and pulling your parachute right away). I’ve been skydiving 8 times and I don’t get the appeal of doing a tandem out of a balloon. I love being under parachute, but free fall is where it’s at (at least for me). I feel the most free during the one minute or so of free fall. After you jump out of that perfectly good airplane (at 13,000ish feet) for one minute your only two worries are checking your altitude to make sure you know when you need to pull your chute and saying holy crap I just jumped from a perfectly good airplane what the F is wrong with 
me. I personally liked (when I was pursing my license) to pull a bit higher than my fellow students. I was super anxious about parachute malfunctions and I wasn’t as confident with the flight pattern to the ground. (Before you can become a student (after two mandatory tandems) you go through a whole day of ground school where they (the instructors) teach you proper exit out of the plane (harder than it looks), proper body position and also what happens after you pull your chute. During student solo jumps once you pull your chute you’re on your own to get to the ground safely so the instructors ingrain every possible parachute malfunction into your brain and what to do when those happen. I wasn’t a super confident skydiver (I did my first jump on a whim, which escalated quickly to 7 more jumps. I do hope to eventually get my anxiety under control enough to actually get my license to skydive solo). 

The drop zone (where you go skydiving) had a grass runway so it wasn’t as easily spotted from the sky."
1758,gEdySFWUfkA,Do I have to watch it till the end to like it

1763,gEdySFWUfkA,just to know that my name is on one of those giant posters is pretty freaking cool man.
1764,gEdySFWUfkA,Amar's talk in the car about building spaces for the Yes Fam such as Yes houses got me thinking.... How fucking awesome would a chain of Yes Hostels all over the world be!?? I would 100% like to get involved if the guys ever want to make that happen.
1765,gEdySFWUfkA,still binge watching
1766,gEdySFWUfkA,Ammar is my spirit animal! The way he approaches every adventure is goals !

1775,EVAlFlAAtrQ,"please collaborate with YouTubers like Anthony Padilla, Mr. Beast, Niko Omilano, Living bobby, Sri Akarshana, Beer biceps or Yongey Mingyur Rimpochae"
1776,EVAlFlAAtrQ,"It didn't even take me a second to think of The person, who deserves this bike.

It's my best friend Domi.

He's putting himself under immense pressure and is working extremely hard  to study his dream subject Mechanical Engeneering.
In addition to this struggle, his Grandmother past away a few days ago. He instantly went home to his family, staying with them to help to get through this and is putting his own needs totally behind those of his family.

Out side of this he has been the best friend I have ever had for the past ~8 years. We've gone through a lot together and I don't know anyone who deserves this more, especially right now!
We've been biking together for a while, but can't anymore since I moved away. I think a Monday bike would be awesome for him, since he is the perfect combination of a  Engeneering Nerd and a Bike Nerd and he just really deserves it!

Peace out and stay sunny
Domi's bestfriend Yannis"
1777,EVAlFlAAtrQ,Ali Abdaal truly deserves that bike!
1778,EVAlFlAAtrQ,I have DM you guys on Instagram
1779,EVAlFlAAtrQ,this is how you do a product placement
1780,EVAlFlAAtrQ,You guys nailed it 😃😃😃👍

1782,EVAlFlAAtrQ,I want wan(1) haha 🥺
1783,EVAlFlAAtrQ,"I nominate RoxAnne Timmons. In the past 2 years she has survived a sudden, unexpected brain bleed and is a more positive and optimistic and appreciative human regardless of the chronic health changes it has caused for her. She is a great friend, exudes kindness and love to all she meets and is a huge inspiration for me. If I could be 1/8th as strong of a woman as her then I’d be successful."
1784,EVAlFlAAtrQ,td 🤩
1785,EVAlFlAAtrQ,"My mom, she has to bike every couple days just to pick up my two siblings, she doesn't own a car and her bike is pretty old."
1786,EVAlFlAAtrQ,"riding bike with a mask on... new normal. still lov u guys, great stuff"
1787,EVAlFlAAtrQ,I'm constantly reminded of how amazing the yes house is. It's got to be what five blocks from Venice Beach 🤤
1788,EVAlFlAAtrQ,"I nominate my father. He takes a 14-km ride of his rusty and old metal bike daily to work. A lot of his income goes to the maintenance of his breaking bike. He is fond of vehicles like what is in Monday Motorbikes. As a Yes fan all the way from the Philippines for years, this will be a great opportunity for you to help a fan countries afar. Thanks for this opportunity!"
1789,EVAlFlAAtrQ,Me because I don't know how to ride a bike.
1790,EVAlFlAAtrQ,I'll be the mom ... where are your helmets boys?
1791,y3YegJBDaA4,No wave off?

1805,y3YegJBDaA4,And The Earth Is Round
1806,y3YegJBDaA4,Why did you guys stare at each other for so long?  Why didn't you look around more? Not a criticism?  Sincere question? Was it for safety to make sure no one passed out?
1807,y3YegJBDaA4,"Can't stop watching this video , might sound a bit morbid but after attempting to   jump off a bridge changing my mind but slipping I now feel I need to actually jump I've never been at real height or in a plane but im in the process of organising a skydive for a mental health charity, feel I need to go full circle from Rock bottom depressed to jumping from as high as possible for charity"
1808,y3YegJBDaA4,What's the name of this tune
1809,y3YegJBDaA4,Whenever i m not feeling good i just return seeing this video. It just calms my inner hustle. Thank you yes theory for this. ❤️

1836,3yw6EPr6jJM,"Matt is such a warm person, and has such warm and kind eyes. 😍😍😍One thing  that hit me straight away is that  his small brother literally dropped school in order  to join him and his friends.  That's  how good of a big brother he is. I tried working with my big brother a couple of times but it just couldn't work out.  We are even in the same profession. 😭😭😭In that episode when TD was to be left penniless in  Thailand, Matt was like please dont get kidnaped or  mom will kill me! He was freaking out. ☹☹☹ Lol! And then in the coming episodes (where Thomas and TD go on adventures together), we see TD referring to Thomas as Dad and Thomas referring to TD as son,😂😂😂 meaning Thomas has taken over Matts role as the caring big brother."
1837,3yw6EPr6jJM,"Wow
Am actually crying"
1838,3yw6EPr6jJM,You are living a life guys ☺️.
1839,3yw6EPr6jJM,I'm in love with Matt. Someone tell him!
1840,3yw6EPr6jJM,"Love ya Matt! I'm sure we'll still see ya around some, you know you can't resist!!"

1846,3yw6EPr6jJM,Looking forward to all view vanishing
1847,3yw6EPr6jJM,"Although I am sad to see you leave the channel I am glad to have been able to get to know you, even if it's just through a screen. I wish you the best of luck with whatever you choose to do in your life."

1860,4fkCEJ0w9yY,2020 was soo hard 4 so many!!! Thanks for helping so many people relize life can be so much more!!!!!
1861,4fkCEJ0w9yY,"I was expecting at least a bit of the ghost town to be presented.  Something like why it was abandoned or even why it was built or anything really.  Also it had been nice if the other guy in the video had been introduced.  The fancy car what was it?  what model?  who was the driver? just someone or a friend of yours?  
It seems that you guys are getting tired of making videos."
1862,4fkCEJ0w9yY,"There is a place in UAE ,Ras Al Khaimah..that people.usually fail to see..
There is a Ghost house in Ras Al Khaimah which is a bit huge..it is said to be haunted...try visiting..as no one ever made a video"
1863,4fkCEJ0w9yY,"Hi guys,.... As u are reading this or ur here watching yes theory .... The chances are that they either inspire you or ur here watching people make people happy which is Also a good sign.....so the thing is.... Me and my friend Rajesh..... Have started. YouTube channel, very much yes theory inspired... Just to get ourselves out of the cage we were brought up in and have to live once we grow up..... So its not that we wanna copy yes theory.... We are do damn big fan boys of these dudes above.... We live for them... And the discomfort we seek is all inspired by them.... Now that we recently started the channel.... We need people who can stand by us and grow together with us once we take theflight... And fall down to the concrete so that we can rise up harder... Just if u think u can help us in any way plz contact us through ... Kondarajesh90@gmail.com...
Yeah we are from INDIA (Hyd)....
We might not be best in this... But we very much learnt to fight....

1877,57P-wczErII,"This is why I love Yestheory, they don't care how people get better or seek to improve themselves. Whether it is through yestheory or keep it wholesome, as long as people get better they are happy!"
1878,57P-wczErII,When is the Collab happening between keep it wholesome and seek discomfort?
1879,57P-wczErII,"Have not seen him after this video on any others, what happened?"
1880,57P-wczErII,wait im screaming -- i love this guy and i'd been following him for so long 😭

1890,57P-wczErII,"I have been following yes theory since its 1st year and never miss a video ever since. The moment I found it in the youtube randomly, I saw its uniqueness, inclusivity and positivity and subscribed."
1891,rtxSFhuFV0s,"Hey guys, I hope you get something out some of the thoughts I had about creativity. Excited to try out a few different ways to convey ideas so I appreciate you watching. Feel free to drop a comment, I love hearing what you all think 💭 have a great week making something!! 🙏"
1892,rtxSFhuFV0s,"Insightful, inspiring words of encouragenebt and commitment ti thge pprocess."
1893,rtxSFhuFV0s,"this just validated the feelings im feeling right now... 
im feeling the burnout from project 30, and have been feeling lesser than for not posting much since. however, like you said, its important to also take a vacation or a break from creating after a while of intense push to just reflect and to revive. so im gonna take that break with all the intention, and then try to find the balance of creating consistently so that i can put out more art into the world. thank you thomas <3 

professor brag always pulls through"
1894,rtxSFhuFV0s,seeing the origins of the yes theory bootcamp in bits and pieces all throughout the years <3
1895,rtxSFhuFV0s,"Thomas you’re a Inspiration!, never give up!”you have a wonderful Talent and Karisma😉"
1896,rtxSFhuFV0s,"For real, where did you get that awesome fleece lined flannel that you wear in the opening shot?  I saw it in another video too. I WANT.  Love your work."
1897,rtxSFhuFV0s,"I recently found your channel and I am serious when I say that I have felt and currently feel inspired by every single video I've watched thus far. There are components of reflection, history, motivation and cultural immersions within each video. You all find such beauty in everything you express to the world, through this medium specifically, and I am so inspired to create because of you. So I guess what I'm trying to convey is an immense thank you for demonstrating that we are so capable of seeking and doing the unknown. You all are blessings to this world."
1898,rtxSFhuFV0s,But also don’t burn yourself out Thomas! That is more important than anything else
1899,rtxSFhuFV0s,"I think a lot too...  looking back at my comment 10months ago..
haha I love being silly too, and I guess there aren't enough of us around (especially where I work)"
1900,rtxSFhuFV0s,"I love this video got recommended to me again after 2 years, especially when I need it the most❤"
1901,rtxSFhuFV0s,"I just got to say your marketing team is top notch, seeing as i came here from an email. I have been aggressively looking for a mentor on creating my own thing whatever that is, with no luck this video helps. MUCH LOVE TO ALL... see you whenever i see you."
1902,rtxSFhuFV0s,Incredible message. I’m thinking of diving into my creativity from my current job. Sending you a vid!
1903,rtxSFhuFV0s,"I love Yea theory.  I love all of you. I love your videos. I love going to countries I never thought about and ones I never knew about.  And I love how you generously donate to those in need you have met in your adventures. And I love organic clothing and when I saw that in your clothes like I bought a sweatshirt for myself.  And more for my nieces. And tees for friends. 

And your game for nieces.

I'm an actor director writer of short stage pieces. I've been acting since college. That's in the 70's.  Now I'm directing a musical for GCP.  I'm not musical.  But we have a musical director for the songs.

I just saw you talk about creativity. And catch yourself, meditation, thinking, oops.  It was an incredibly honest moment!  

I make cards every Xmas for cast members and valentine's I love to give people I come across on February 14. Especially whom I will never see again.

Creativity.  You all are super creative Beings.  I just in my heart of hearts wish you all all Love big Love. And continue going where no one else has and in that going you bring more good will than anyone. Anyone.  Anyone.  

I love love love watching your videos.  I found you during the pandemic.  Thank you for all the joy and connectedness you bring to US.

Thank you with all my Heart. Olga"

2010,k4gnhRZWoxI,"Wow that’s truly impressive, love the attention to detail. The most inspirational video ever !!!! 🙌🙌"
2011,WlcSIoNpFHU,Ammar you're the best ❤❤ a great listener- so genuine. what an amazing human being❤
2012,WlcSIoNpFHU,For a meeting this important and intimate a skilled facilitator would have been helpful. Seems to me there was some major subtext going on. Sometimes a system can become too closed and a so-called outside perspective can offer guidance and care.
2013,WlcSIoNpFHU,Matt is an exceptional writer. I love his news letter. — I just wanna give Ammar a huge hug! He was so quit & in his thoughts 😣😢 I love that they are setting such a good example of men being able to talk about their feelings and dive into such deep discussions. May God continue to protect this group at all costs. ♥️🙏
2014,WlcSIoNpFHU,How many times do you use “like” in your conversation…. Listen to the words your using…..”like do you get it!!!”
2015,WlcSIoNpFHU,Review your conversations;  listen to the words your using to go verse your message. TRY TO  NOT USE THE WORD “Like!”… cause you could find a better word to link your words into coherent sentences…..  no more “like” in your conversation.
2016,WlcSIoNpFHU,"So much wisdom🙌which comes from the hardest task of being honest with oneself. It is very inspiring and comforting to this 59 yr old emotional expert, you are great role models for your viewers, especially men who have not had examples of the true strength of showing up emotionally and lovingly. Inner work IS what sustains us, it is uncomfortable therefore it takes a lot of courage to stay with it and hear it out as you expressed so well yet that is what makes us grow and allows us to be freer to be ourselves."
2017,WlcSIoNpFHU,"Okay.  I am just 10 minutes in and I think any student of Organizational Psychology would say this is like the best boardroom meeting ever!  Matt/Thomas/Ammar/Thomas!  If you ever write a book on organizational psychology - I would read it.  Coz you guys have navigated serious growth and restructuring issues without serious conflict!  I had also started reading about your MBTI types and I think you are all NF types - Intuitive Feelers and that's why you get along so well.  Diplomats!  And as a person who will not work with my siblings at all, I am very impressed by how Matt took his young brother under his wing and made him comfortable with his own friends and he found his own calling. I wish I had that with my own siblings, but I know it will not happen coz we just don't get along and they'll just steamroll me all day long."
2018,WlcSIoNpFHU,"This is what's strong about YesTheory for them too is because you're applying this philosophy constantly of seeking discomfort & going after things that scares you but you know are needed for your well being & understanding of others & everything, as a collective you all apply to that for the good of YesTheory, the channel & the legacy but also individually in your own journey & life. That's extremely powerful, being able to have something that a collective of people are working on but also makes you work on yourself so much too is crasy powerful. #YesTheory definitively not a youtube channel but a legacy of how you should approach things in life & how to betterness yourself & those around you"
2019,WlcSIoNpFHU,And we love you a lot! Thank you for everything that you have done to make the world a better place. And yes  That brand is what people will recognize all over the world is Seek discomfort  brand alone will bring people together when they see it. So thank you again and please keep Bach on going
2020,WlcSIoNpFHU,Boring
2021,WlcSIoNpFHU,I wonder where is Derin now?
2022,WlcSIoNpFHU,Those yellow Converse though ❤❤❤❤
2023,WlcSIoNpFHU,"So glad to have seen this video. I'm also really excited about what you guys ate doing and your intentions for your brand and compwny , its very inspiring. And you guys seeking g discomfort internally and externally is so commendable be cause it's so easy to seek discomfort in only one way and get stuck thinking you're succeeding and everything is fine and not be growing. Frankly I've started to realize seeking discomfort externally is almost easier than seeking discomfort internally, its almost too real to seek discomfort internally. For me I've noticed I have desired seeking discomfort in outrageous ways in part to not have to face my internal struggle and to escape the mundane."
2024,WlcSIoNpFHU,21:00 YESSS free the child.

I know you have been to Denmark before, maybe I can find a way to know where you will be going beforehand... And catch you in Denmark next time ;) Or maybe I might just jump the wagon and go track you guys down somewhere out there in the big bad bad beautiful world ;) Cheers guys, take care and have fun :) <3"
2028,WlcSIoNpFHU,Really sad to see how brain washed you guys are by the left and the media without seeing the truth

2030,WlcSIoNpFHU,I really enjoyed just listening to you guys be real and have a good conversation with each other. I haven’t started listening to the podcast yet. But I hope it’s filled with insights and stories like this. 👌
2031,4cF9JevYBDE,"There's  a lot of nudity in Swedish and French traditions, so I guess thats why they are comfortable being in the nude around each other."

2043,4cF9JevYBDE,"Thomas: 2:43

Me: sir, get some help"
2044,4cF9JevYBDE,Thanks for the laughs 😄😄
2045,4cF9JevYBDE,"This should be retitled to ""Trying to breath for 3 minutes"" i had to close my laptop because i actually couldnt breath"
2046,4cF9JevYBDE,This whole video made me laugh so hard I cried
2047,4cF9JevYBDE,Thomas you stole the show...

2191,J8GBW6xsDN0,"Thanks for watching everyone! We're working on ramping all our videos back-up again, excited to have you here :)"
2192,J8GBW6xsDN0,"Always good to remember that if you're constantly adjusting your life to satisfy others come on you're not really living,  and just because something is a tradition in your family, culture, heritage, doesn't mean it's for you or that it's right"
2193,J8GBW6xsDN0,Where is that painting now. Would be interesting to see the value now.
2194,J8GBW6xsDN0,"But the way TD hugged Ammar, sooooo sweet"

2199,J8GBW6xsDN0,I’ve watched a few Project 30 vids but this prompts me to watch them all. Love that Tommy joined in…he’s little brother amongst his big bro’s. 🇳🇿🇳🇿🐑🐑

2204,J8GBW6xsDN0,Enjoyable waxing pain!!???
2205,J8GBW6xsDN0,"i always feel so sentimental looking back on your guys early days! i had come across you the channel probably about 5 years ago while looking through travel vlogs and had someone stumbled onto yes theory, & i admittedly ate that shit up. swear me and my friends thought we were gonna be the midwest yes theory (we even had 4 of us that had somewhat matched the personalities of each original yes theory member in videos, funnily enough)...the craziest part is that i was going into 8th grade at the time and now i'm moving to LA from the midwest (midwesterners understand the amount of sweat that comes form saying that sentence) for college, fully inspired by people that submit to the yes theory??? the snowball effect is so great sometimes."
2206,J8GBW6xsDN0,whatttt all of them is good looking!
2207,J8GBW6xsDN0,"The educated roadway superficially want because wallet molecularly irritate plus a penitent bone. uncovered, obnoxious hearing"
2208,J8GBW6xsDN0,its football not soccer
2209,J8GBW6xsDN0,7:14 killed me. Is no one going to address it?
2210,J8GBW6xsDN0,It's seriously impressive that even your first videos were that high quality. You could post them today and they'd still hold up.

2218,48JfBwmffuU,Matt's sense of fashion tho
2219,48JfBwmffuU,"This channel is like an ode to the Yes Theory beginning videos. The vibe is soo like that young, energetic and broke type. I love it.🤩"
2220,48JfBwmffuU,And at 2000 votes you bleach your beart Matt? 🤣
2221,48JfBwmffuU,"90% of the time, I totally want friends like the Yes Theory guys. And then there are times like these. XD"

2225,48JfBwmffuU,Im dying inside watching this
2226,48JfBwmffuU,Who's rewatching while looking for new videos from yes theory?
2227,48JfBwmffuU,"Yes Theory! I have an amazing idea for you all and your FUTURE! I comment on all of your videos but I am manifesting that this time I will finally get a response! I don't want to put too much on here, but it involves a web page that serves as a connection for those who want to travel and seek discomfort but may be on a budget! I is kinda hard to find other yes theory fans when I travel, and you guys have the premier opportunity to be the leader in the travel industry for this travel connection service. Please respond!!! This could very well be the comment that changes your lives."

2244,hvBJM7VINoU,bro who tf adopts a dog for 2 weeks tho
2245,hvBJM7VINoU,This was awesome. You guys should make a schedule to allow having a permanent Yes Theory dog. I'm sure a lot of people would volunteer to pet sit when you have to travel. It would be great also to include the dog in your adventures.
2246,hvBJM7VINoU,#1 cute
2247,hvBJM7VINoU,if only u could give that dog a yestheroy dog collar just to say they were appart of the yestheroy team
2248,hvBJM7VINoU,I feel like you guys should at least post not to donate to her anymore.. A simple google search and you can see the adoption woman is not a good person.  :(
2249,hvBJM7VINoU,Did he keep the puppy?

2275,7QIEU9KkY5g,Wowww super nice content 😮😊
2276,7QIEU9KkY5g,"Once again, proving that the media and news are rarely on point with reality. So many places in the world are like this. Plagued by untrue rumors and misconceptions that keep people away. Paris, China seems like an awesome place!"
2277,7QIEU9KkY5g,Interesting and bizarre. Unfortunately the unsteady video flickering and flashing between scenes is almost unwatchable.
2278,7QIEU9KkY5g,great video!
2279,7QIEU9KkY5g,"at 13:50 the stepped waterfall and pond looks like its based on Parc de saint cloud, Paris"

2281,7QIEU9KkY5g,1
2282,7QIEU9KkY5g,That looks cool as hell. I just went to Taiwan and it’s really sparked a curiosity in me to visit China. I just love the culture.

2284,7QIEU9KkY5g,Lady is 100 years old. Respect

The connections and memories you’ve made throughout these years of doing Yes Theory truly blows my mind. I hope to truly embody the idea of “Seek Discomfort” someday myself. And to Matt, as sad as it is to see you go after so many years of enjoying your presence with the Yes Fam, I wish you the absolute best.

2311,nxdh69enoSw,You'd bet that many of us haven't heard of Turkmenistan? Sweet condescending intro homie. EADU
2312,nxdh69enoSw,It's like a city out of a sci-fi flick. A clinically clean and strange dystopian place with nobody around.
2313,nxdh69enoSw,dream destination is usa
2314,nxdh69enoSw,"This is THE BEST TRAVEL VIDEO I've Ever seen!!  Love the Fun & the people of Turkmenistan was AMAZING! What a Brilliant opportunity to meet such happy, friendly, welcoming & gracious people!! What is their main form of income?  It must be a wealthy country to be able to afford so many incredible monuments.  I wonder why it's so difficult to visit this country when the people obviously enjoy meeting new people."
2315,nxdh69enoSw,"This was beautiful, especially the message at the end💙🙏"
2316,nxdh69enoSw,"The timing of the posting of this extraordinary video is appropriate. It is a message to the World. How to connect with one another, how to communicate with each other. And above all how to respect each other. This video should be compulsory viewing for the Politicians and decision makers all over the World. What an excellent job by your team. In a darkening World this video is a Beacon of Light."

2321,nxdh69enoSw,My dream trip would be to Guam to rediscover some of my heritage and share the beauty of the island and the people with my wife and twin teenage boys.  Thank you!  I look forward to seeing more of your eye-opening and fun videos.  🫶
2322,nxdh69enoSw,I don’t understand why you guys aren’t as big as mr beast. You have to be shadow banned because there’s no reason this positive content with over 100k likes isn’t all over everywhere

WHERES YOUR VOICE OR HUMANITARIAN AID IS SELECTIVE ONLY FOR UKRAINE 
You made video about Ukraine war and help them, where’s your voice about Palestinian 🇵🇸
Shame Shame Shame"
2337,cd9or9hVpAw,"I remember the vlog where Matt discussed backing off.  I had tears in my eyes but when we are committed to our growth, there are changes that take place.  It is part of the growth process.  And, Thomas, you are correct.  It is a never ending process.  It is never completed."

2352,_zxVcpOzOPY,There is a big difference between being lonely and being alone.
2353,_zxVcpOzOPY,Bro is living the life
2354,_zxVcpOzOPY,I'm the loneliest. Nobody knows.
2355,_zxVcpOzOPY,I want to know more about the dog. I'm sure it had a huge role
2356,_zxVcpOzOPY,"I think most of these people are comfortable or happy in their isolation and enjoy the nature and being self sufficient , they've choosen their lifestyle, so many people have become isolated for lots of reasons.I imagine many people would like to swap places with these people.  I think it would be good to see an accompanying video about people in towns or cities who are isolated and lonely,  disconnected from the people who surround them. Lonely and invisible in the crowd. Cut off from their own neighbours etc , there's no shortage of lonely people in every town or city in the world. I don't think anyone in your video felt lonely,  they were mostly happy  in their isolation. Thank you for your video and for being interested in lonely or isolated people."
2357,_zxVcpOzOPY,misleading as the title was it is effective in it's purpose. these people are thriving and very inspirational. great video for understanding the human condition a little better. kind of shows the difference of what quality over quantity really means. loneliness is terrible it can be the worst the importance of recognizing it and understanding how to help each other can't be said enough
2358,_zxVcpOzOPY,Loneliest Person*s*
2359,_zxVcpOzOPY,Agafia. All you need to know.
2360,_zxVcpOzOPY,"So amazing to get connection to others , 😂❤❤❤"
2361,_zxVcpOzOPY,So Erik also has a barber in his house?
2362,_zxVcpOzOPY,You guys should try find a 'Qivittoq' in Greenland😅 it a person who leaves in mountains without contact to modern greenland
2363,_zxVcpOzOPY,"Is good go to those places...did you give gift of clothing,food,shoes,thing for the house?part of be good human being....I don't undertood why live in this condition..and why people with a lot of abundance help this people..where is love ,compation?"
2364,_zxVcpOzOPY,Hello guy's iam from Greece a hope visit again the Grecce and travel in Crette Island and see how living the shepherd on Psiloritis(Ψηλορείτης) mountain please search that shepherd Giannis Papasifakis how his a lives on the mountain thank you
2365,_zxVcpOzOPY,Swedish man sounds like Elon Musk
2366,_zxVcpOzOPY,Badass guy
2367,_zxVcpOzOPY,Chi e la donna? Lei e incredibile
2368,_zxVcpOzOPY,"yeah whatever, I just felt in love with the italian girl"
2369,_zxVcpOzOPY,The great thing about your videos is that you all love people & life! Inspiring how love is the great meaning
2370,_zxVcpOzOPY,Alone. Not lonely
2371,kwsWAQ9sJZE,The Truth Will Set You Free
2372,kwsWAQ9sJZE,I believe 🥰
2373,kwsWAQ9sJZE,Grusch doesn't have an iota of direct evidence.  It's all hearsay and speculation. Complete hot air.
2374,kwsWAQ9sJZE,"Get away from fame.  You are giving the black government bullets!  Watch your back, dont trust anyone!  Thank you for what you have done.  If its easy, something is wrong!"
2375,kwsWAQ9sJZE,Why does it seem like only the US has info about this? EU countries especially small ones would make this info public or speak out about it.
2376,kwsWAQ9sJZE,23:48 You have a background in psychological analysis?
2377,kwsWAQ9sJZE,never trust the government
2378,kwsWAQ9sJZE,"This video is really well-made, and I totally respect that. Although, I would like to share my thoughts on the matter.
The fact that all this information is from the US instantly makes me skeptical. This is where most of the flat earth movement is and, similar to me, crazy theories originate. Arguments stating that ""I was skeptical at first too"" is something that's very common to hear in theory crafting groups. I personally don't buy it. 

But as in every topic, please prove me wrong. Being proven wrong only grows your mindset into something better."
2379,kwsWAQ9sJZE,another jew money making scam
2380,kwsWAQ9sJZE,It's just military aircrafts
2381,kwsWAQ9sJZE,"I remember a lady said in the comments of a video something like ""Now that we are a civilized world I'm sure they will contact us."" I didn't understand what he meant when he said ""civilized world"", I don't see such a world, I can only see wars.
I don't think they will contact us soon, to Fermi (who died) I would say that they have no interest in contacting us, why should they be so interested if they have known about us forever? They are also more advanced, maybe more intelligent, or maybe not, and maybe longer lived. Or perhaps they lived less and their advancement was slower, allowing them to advance empathically, and so they were less at risk of self-destruction. Let me explain, if they live less their progress is slower, just imagine how many things would have changed if Einstein, Newton, Marie Curie, etc. They would have lived to be 35 years old.
Lastly, we don't know what happens out there, we don't know where ""out there"" is either, if they wanted to harm us they would have done it now, or centuries ago. Nor do we know to what extent they perhaps protect us from ourselves, and to what extent they protect themselves but without harming us. Thanks for reading my ""delirium"" LOL"
2382,kwsWAQ9sJZE,"I want this info to be real with every cell in my body, but, knowing the  extent the super rich and our government go to manipulate and control information, and people, I can only be skeptical that there’s a very intentional reason this is happening and it’s setting the stage for something  😢"
2383,kwsWAQ9sJZE,Why dont you just put him on lie detector test?

In August we always take a few weeks off to rest, but since we got back we’ve been scheming, filming and editing non-stop. We’ve got several episodes in the can and many more coming. A lot of surprises in the coming months.. much to look forward to. We’re so excited to be back!! Can anyone guess which countries we’ll travel to this season? 🤓

2419,JPPMz8fEml0,"I was genuinely shocked to see that Lebanon is considered the angriest country. Yes, the government is worthless and useless in every way which definitely has played a part, but the Lebanese people are some of the most generous in the world. Peace and love to our brothers and sisters in Beirut and all of Lebanon. May these wonderful people and their great country know only economic stability, peace, and freedom soon."

That moment you guys were using shovels and complaining then Master Shi Heng Yi explains 
""There are times in life we feel suffering and the question is how can we get through challenges and still feel good about life""

2491,gqeLROyFnVQ,"Update July 1st, 2023:

The 21-Day Pay What You Want Window has already closed, and we're super happy for everyone that got to rent the film on it! 

But if you're here after that and still haven't gotten to watch the film, no worries! You can now buy the film at the link at the description at a fixed price. Watch as many times as you want for as long as you want - use code YT20OFF at checkout for 20% off.

it feels quite surreal to be bringing a very challenging chapter of my life in regards to my relationship with family to an end and create space for a new one to begin. I can’t even begin to describe what it meant to see my life’s work, project iceman film, be the very reason my dad completely understood what is it that I do and why. I felt seen by him for the first time since the start of my yes Theory journey. Endlessly grateful to everyone who’s stuck around with us to witness this happy ending. Now please go watch the film and let us know back here in the comments what you thought.. you’re support means the world ❤️

Also for anyone wondering where Thomas is, he unfortunately had to cancel his flight to Dubai 24 hours before departure due to an emergency that came up. He was there via FaceTime and always in spirit 🫶🏽"

2495,gqeLROyFnVQ,Bros dad lost 6 years w his son because of his dumbass beliefs
2496,gqeLROyFnVQ,"This was so heartwarming. I had tears building up at some parts where your dad was so proud of what you have achieved. I dont have a special relationship with most of my family, yet i yearn for something that will never be. My dad is so special to me but we dont get to spend time together as i would have hoped. Seeing the universal feelings of love from around the world is so touching. it shows that despite our differences, or geographical locations, we are all the same.
Thank you for creating such inspiring and motivational films."

Love you guys! This moment transformed my life, and I will forever carry it as a compass and guiding light. That when fear hits hard, we can breathe and let it flow through our body and let miracles be born. I feel reborn after this jump!

I also want to say endless thanks for all your support since joining the team officially. You guys make me cry my eyes out of gratitude!! The world is feeling lonely, and for me the Yes Fam is an island of hope. Let’s keep changing the world together. Love you all! <3

2520,WZpPIR5jiCk,The first video I ever watched of yes theory was with Stefan swapping lives with someone in the US. I was hooked in high school but just started to watch the videos again. It’s a funny timeline since I have just started watching again and now he is a team member of yes theory!  Thanks for the headspace trial! I am excited to start as I have just moved across country alone to start flight school. I have had the dream to be a pilot since 2017 but was not able to make the risk until now. The financial risk and obvious difficulties of breaking into a male dominated industry with no mentors are all exciting discomforts to experience this year!
2521,WZpPIR5jiCk,Steffan having an anxiety attack when you surprise him is ligit me !
2522,WZpPIR5jiCk,Steffan was such a good addition to the team!! He’s so calming and easy to be around

Worlds most dangerous? Oh please. You jumped a tandem wingsuit with an extremely experienced wingsuit and tandem pilot, you guys had a tandem gear, you guys had a massive main canopy (~350sqft), you guys had a reserve which was repacked yearly, you guys had an AAD, you guys had an RSL (probably a MARD too), you guys had a lots of reserve altitude for in an event of a malfunction. All those safety features. Don't tell me it was world's most dangerous. Not first, not world's, and most importantly not dangerous at all.

2528,WZpPIR5jiCk,Some of us understand that you're upping the ante not because you want to enrich experiences but because you want to maintain the viewer count. I would never RISK my friend's safety through an unproven method just to make a buck. Fkn despicable.

2531,Mm-ZhXVGnPg,"What do you guys believe is the secret to a long-lasting and fulfilling life? We were discussing as a team and the word that kept coming up was community. 

Being around people that support us deeply and participating together in something bigger than ourselves, in our opinion, are two big components behind this secret. 

That's one of the reasons we're so proud of you, our community - the Yes Fam. 

For over 5 years you've been interacting, meeting up, being there for each other and creating one of the most positive environments we know exists on the internet (and out of it!). 

Sometimes making friends seems so hard, but maybe it's just a matter of where you're looking for them.

If you want to be in touch with the most incredible people we know and find a community for yourself, we highly encourage you to get to know the Yes Fam! You can sign up here: https://yestheorycommunity.substack.com/

When you do, we'll send you an email about how to join, what groups & platforms exist, what local groups possibly exist in the area you live in, etc and before you know it you'll be in a challenge or a meetup with everyone :)

We love telling these stories on YouTube and inspiring you to put yourself out there, but what we love the most is seeing you meet people that are going to support you in your journey of living the Yes Theory in your own life and Seeking DIscomfort.

Hope to see you guys there :)"
2532,Mm-ZhXVGnPg,"Presently, mortgage rates have reached their highest point since the year 2000, spanning a period of 23 years. Considering inflation trends, there's a possibility that this figure might continue to escalate. To provide context, the 30-year fixed rate was only at 5% around this same time last year. Faced with this scenario, the question arises: should I continue waiting in anticipation of a potential housing market downturn before making a purchase, or is it more prudent to shift my attention towards the equity market?"

2534,Mm-ZhXVGnPg,"So ikigai sounds similar to raison d'etre en francais etc. But for me just knowing that my 6 pets and 2 kids need me makes me get up when I don't want to. They all need to be fed, the dogs need to be walked, the litter needs to scooped. Ya know? 

For them their moai and their neighbors and their  family give them the sense of belonging and interdependence and support or something to look forward to and being needed."

He has always been the most active human being I've ever known and Hiking up until about a week before his death and he didn't even die because of old age, he had an injury where he couldn't recover due to his age"
2550,Mm-ZhXVGnPg,"You forgot one!!  AND will be the key to living past 100+ like the Blue Zone tell us: PLANT-BASED EATING!!!!!!  ALL the Blue Zone tell us that we can eat plant-based eating*, and lead into community, ikiagai, etc. Maybe Yes Theory is avoiding that. It is the long-term gain, not short-term gain, which, unfortunately, Yes Theory is about. Search for ""blue zones okinawa diet"" images, you'll see.

*(with some exceptions)"
2551,pR_QkaDRVg0,"Hey, we hope you liked the video! Yes Theory's Second Channel here!

So we were curious as a team, which part of the video did you like the most? On our end it was the part of the developed portraits of the abandoned film camera! It's so crazy we still can't believe it!

2552,pR_QkaDRVg0,I saw a shadow moving @18:43 . I know I must not be the only one. The work you guys do is so incredible 🎉🎉
2553,pR_QkaDRVg0,give us the actual f*ckin history of the place
2554,pR_QkaDRVg0,only in Japan that they can make an abandoned hotel looks so poetic.
2555,pR_QkaDRVg0,Even when it was new the hotel was only mediocre; defintiely not as gorgeous as the hotel in Tianducheng (fake Paris).
2556,pR_QkaDRVg0,Damn! How could they found my old corn-hoard? I thought an abandoned house on an abonded island in Japan would be secret enough!
2557,pR_QkaDRVg0,"I wish you would bring those photos back somehow so other people visiting can see them, that would be sick"
2558,pR_QkaDRVg0,"Last year I accidentally stumbled across the abandoned Hotel  at dusk on my way to Aogashima. The atmosphere on the island is very particular, hard to describe. Eerie and kind of otherworldly."
2559,pR_QkaDRVg0,20:20 that is the coolest looking room ever. Last of us vibes.
2560,pR_QkaDRVg0,For those wondering the hotel owner left everything behind becuz it was more expensive to bring back the stuff into mainland Japan.
2561,pR_QkaDRVg0,I love abandoned places! They are so mysterious and creepy but at the same time so amazig and beautiful 🤩 good job guys!
2562,pR_QkaDRVg0,"5:50 ""dvd's"" yall too young its VHS tapes lol"
2563,pR_QkaDRVg0,Come to Panama soon
2564,pR_QkaDRVg0,Okay how about accommodating displaced refugees of war like isis or Ukraine ? Employ them in the coal mine and sell the coal to developing nations at a competitive rate. Miners get a life and able to raise kids and help the economy at the same time. Or inhabit them in chinas ghost towns
2565,pR_QkaDRVg0,"18:26 it actually does look like someone is standing in the dark, you can see their shoes (?)"
2566,pR_QkaDRVg0,Straight out of music video
2567,pR_QkaDRVg0,"11:35 It is rude to point a camera at someone without their consent. If you want to interview someone, you must have permission to film. This is common etiquette in Japan.
And the official language of Japan is Japanese. Please speak to them in Japanese.
Many people, especially older people in the countryside, may not understand you if you speak to them in English. Also, shy people may run away because they do not want to be noticed.
Distance and privacy with others is important. Act with respect and it will go well."
2568,pR_QkaDRVg0,Are you looking for quie chane kane
2569,pR_QkaDRVg0,I think you were in a deserted atomic fishing village from the suamie  were you guys doing kamasuta positions at the motel eat some raw fish an bugs

2586,cS_lzYjLgYA,"What an absolutely amazing group of men!  Steffan did such a lovely job of overcoming his fears, kudis to him!"
2587,cS_lzYjLgYA,I love how the Sumos were going so easy on them like they are children 😂 It was very kind.
2588,cS_lzYjLgYA,"That isn't Testosterone, that's Estrogen. Estrogen builds fat. This is medical facts ask a any doctor."
2589,cS_lzYjLgYA,"Everything +100 Years is ""mystery"" to US People. Because they have no history, except killing people alredy live in a country they raid."

2624,F3D1piLc3K4,"I feel like i never will have the chance to go to places like that. But at least we can travel to the Philippines once a year to visit family. We went to Hongkong, Japan Osaka, Ireland, Portugal and the Netherlands....
All of that is so much money already. But traveling to places like that must be crazy to pay for."
2625,F3D1piLc3K4,come to ethiopia please
2626,F3D1piLc3K4,"I love this show, it lets me feel the extreme emotions of fear of something new and adventure( I love it when you take complete strangers), and when everyone begins to know each other and they are vibing off each other, it gives me a connected feeling I can't explain( I loved it when you guys went out drinking because the next day you all knew each other as friends). I feel like if my life went differently this could be me although I wouldn't trade my life for anything. I get to feel both through this channel. One of the top channels on YouTube period."
2627,F3D1piLc3K4,Looks amazing

2631,QO7Ymd99RtY,"Turks and Caicos! 
I know I'm way late. Lol. 
❤"
2632,QO7Ymd99RtY,"Agree.


Passport is a small aspect of this recurring human social feature where a long going system puts many people at a disadvantage for fault of some and no fault of others and puts others at an advantage when that is hardly a necessity for them.

Passport is a small aspect of this whole thing, and probably not that crucial in many people lives compared to other salient benefits and drawbacks generated through birth in a particular manner.

The good thing in all these dichotomies is all these inadvertent human created aspects provides challenge to be overcome for some, a goal to achieve, a direction in life while the same thing can well turn out poisonous for others, weakening point for them, making them out of touch and unrealistic with many realities around the world.

The world do provide opportunities from time to time make each other knowledgeable of these things but it takes much more effort to withstand the experience of each other."
2633,QO7Ymd99RtY,"As a South African, I can really confirm that they make traveling for Africans really hard and you are interrogated like a criminal."
2634,QO7Ymd99RtY,when are guys setting up in asia ah ?

2637,QO7Ymd99RtY,"I’ve watched YouTube for 5 years. And it wasn’t until last week that I discovered Yes Theory. My only regret is not finding you sooner! This content is brilliant, beautiful, meaningful, and truly, truly inspiring. My husband and I have cried so many tears over the last week as we have binged the videos. #seekdiscomfort"
2638,QO7Ymd99RtY,First time hearing St Kitts. I am really enjoying your platform because i getting informed.
2639,QO7Ymd99RtY,"Instead of blaming countries for being skeptical of who visits their countries and keeping their own citizens safe, take responsibility for your country and their past and why their passport is what it is. If you don’t like the story and the past, change it."
2640,QO7Ymd99RtY,Immigrations officer’s name means ‘Generous’ in Arabic. Absolutely fitting. Beautiful stuff man
2641,QO7Ymd99RtY,Yo! they listening to Skeng in the car @10:56 !!! lol...already in the Caribbean music culture 🙌

2646,QO7Ymd99RtY,I've always wanted to go to Tahiti and French Polynesian.
2647,QO7Ymd99RtY,What an absolutely stunningly beautiful country to have citizenship of!
2648,QO7Ymd99RtY,So he was basically to much of a coward to join their army?
2649,QO7Ymd99RtY,"Glad Ammar got the passport.... from St Kitts....nice to see that you guys went to the place that ""adopted"" you . Even though its not a requirement, to me it shows respect to the country and shows that new citizens are not takong advantage of their kindness so to speak. Also, funny thing is,they try and ask Canada if they could join. 😆 Just curious, out of all the CBI places in the Carrebean, why St Kitts vs the others In the price range? What made u pick it. Also sorry u cant visit Egypt yet. Maybe soon ❤am gonna sub 😉"

2670,u7eLwLeNLt8,Am really surprised that the people of Somali land speak good English 😳
2671,u7eLwLeNLt8,Are you kidding me bruh???!?!? Somaliland is far far better and stable then Somalia itself 😮
2672,u7eLwLeNLt8,THank you for this amazing Video about My Country Somaliland ❤❤❤
2673,u7eLwLeNLt8,"Somaliland is a beautiful, peaceful phoenix risen from the ashes. It's time for the world to recognise this incredible and wonderful little nation."
2674,u7eLwLeNLt8,Is your title even making sense 😳😳😳
2675,u7eLwLeNLt8,"Everyone needs more than their salary to be financial stable. The best thing to do with your money is to invest it rightly, because money left for saving always end up used with no returns."

2677,u7eLwLeNLt8,"So much war and poverty in Africa, it's easy to see why so many flee to nearby countries. If only they could leave their violence and disposition behind"
2678,u7eLwLeNLt8,"Did she just say civilisation?????? Cuz that's insanely stupid lollll, proof of human existence is all of a sudden CIVILISATION loooooolllllll she clearly doesn't know what civilisation means"
2679,u7eLwLeNLt8,Good work. Giving a different narrative to what the other media outlets churn out. I invite you to Borno Nigeria to change the narratives.
2680,u7eLwLeNLt8,"As a Kurd we share much of the same problem as Somaliland, however instead of one aggressor occupying us, we have instead four. Iraq ,Iran ,Turkey and Syria, we also went through horrible genocide attempts in the hands of dictator Saddam Hussein and his baath party 1991. 
But just like Somaliland our resolve gained us some freedom in the form of semi-autonomy, and hopefully the other three parts can unite to form greater Kurdistan. 
I hope by then Somaliland also have gained freedom and prosperity, btw even our flags are similar! Containing the colours of: Green, White, Red and the Sun/Star in the middle.   
❤☀💚   
💚⭐❤"
2681,u7eLwLeNLt8,Wait can someone explain why it’s like that. It’s my first time hearing Somali land. I thought it was one country. And is there problems between both.
2682,u7eLwLeNLt8,"Watching this right now, I cant help but see the similarities of what is going on right now with the genocide of Palastine"

2688,NqI6PMRxT0Y,"Hi Thomas. I lived in the DRCongo for 35 years and have spent days and weeks in villages like that one in Cameroon. In Congo the Baka are called Batwa. But the culture is extremely similar. I shot in a Batwa village a few years ago for a documentary and it was a highlight of my life. The sincerity and hospitality of the people is extraordinary. Their love of singing and dancing and belief in a Higher Power is, I feel, part of the key to their happiness and mental health even though they live in extremely difficult circumstances. Thank you for sharing your experience. It brought back many very warm memories."
2689,NqI6PMRxT0Y,@seekdiscomfort - this is amazing! Your dedication to connecting with people and exploring unique cultures truly resonates with my love for adventure and appreciation of diverse experiences.
2690,NqI6PMRxT0Y,You guys are really brave or have a death wish. I would be scared shitless of cannibalism in these tribes.

2698,NqI6PMRxT0Y,"China is also buying and investing so much in Africa (not in a good way for what studies and migrants tell me) it will soon turn for the worst.

2707,RwOltQUMDa4,My beautiful Ghana... Beautiful People Beautiful Culture. God bless my Homeland
2708,RwOltQUMDa4,I love how that Ghanaian is proudly explaining about their culture of shooting gunpowder
2709,RwOltQUMDa4,"I am so in love with this video, thank you Yes Theory ♥️"
2710,RwOltQUMDa4,Just like the Congolese do
2711,RwOltQUMDa4,"My aunt did a DNA test and found that we were of Senegalese, Ghanaian, and Malian decent. I would like to have a funeral like this when my time comes as a last token to my ancestors."
2712,RwOltQUMDa4,"Generally, in almost every original African culture, we find reasons to celebrate every event (good, bad & the ugly). If it is good, we celebrate that it is good. If it is bad, we celebrate that we survived it. And if it is ugly, we celebrate to make it look better. 

Irrespective of the circumstance, some kind of celebration is in order in most African cultures. Of course, when Africans choose to celebrate then, some dancing, singing, eating and drinking are imperative. If there is no dancing, singing and eating, it is certainly NOT a ceremony in Africa.👌"
2713,RwOltQUMDa4,It's so sad that they be dancing like yet their loved one might be in torment in hell
2714,RwOltQUMDa4,Here in Ghana a day before the  funeral they play music the whole night and people don't sleep. people dance the whole night
2715,RwOltQUMDa4,It is wrong. They are not happy. I have been on their funerals too. They dance and sing but they are not happy.
2716,RwOltQUMDa4,"We Ghanaians say good bye to our love ones in a grand style.

Saying our final goodbye.

We love and value life so when anybody goes we need to celebrate their existence on earth."
2717,RwOltQUMDa4,Awesome
2718,RwOltQUMDa4,Beautiful people!
2719,RwOltQUMDa4,Ghanaians love you too
2720,RwOltQUMDa4,My dad's funeral is next month 17th November in Nigeria come see how we bury our love one.
2721,RwOltQUMDa4,"Not only in Ghana,it happens in Nigeria too."
2722,RwOltQUMDa4,In Africa we attend funerals not even knowing them as long as your near it's amust to attend 😂😂😂
2723,RwOltQUMDa4,"I hate funeral traditions of my background. Men only, stupid religious traditions, and no focus on the remembrance of one's life – but just a fear involved in said (stupid) religious beliefs."
2724,RwOltQUMDa4,Que un funeral sea asi hace el pesar por la muerte sea más llevado. Tenemos mucho que aprender de estas culturas.

2726,d2Dw-PuNZSE,"Hi friends, I hope you enjoy this wild and incredible story. To address a technical aspect I’m sure a few commenters will point out 🤓🫶 depending on how you measure and which source you find, another island “Tristan Da Cunha” has claimed to be most remote. That’s because it’s 7-day boat ride to the nearest airport instead of the 4-day trip it took me to Pitcairn. But if you measure distance from closest continent, Pitcairn blows them all out of the park. Ultimately, Pitcairn’s unbelievable story is what made me chose to go there, you all know by now that a 7-day boat trip wouldn’t scare me away if the stronger story was on the other island. I hope you enjoyed the video as much as we did making it 🙏"
2727,d2Dw-PuNZSE,I was born and raised in Hawaii living the popolynesian life
2728,d2Dw-PuNZSE,Please send me there i want to live alone thare iam 20 year old i don't like humans i just want to stay with nature
2729,d2Dw-PuNZSE,I want to Live there 😢😢 i love to live alone in dark
2730,d2Dw-PuNZSE,"My nephew is named after Fletcher Christian. William Bligh was an awful, awful man who's a big part of Australian history (none of it good), so we grew up knowing his name here in Sydney. So, safe to say, I'm loving this and will be sending it to my dad who grew up telling us all about the Mutiny."
2731,d2Dw-PuNZSE,I thought Tristan Di Cunha was the most isolated human Habitat.
2732,d2Dw-PuNZSE,Wrong. Do your reserch. Idiots.
2733,d2Dw-PuNZSE,Ive seen quite a few documentarys on Pitcairn
2734,d2Dw-PuNZSE,mindblowing
2735,d2Dw-PuNZSE,That was pretty cool
2736,d2Dw-PuNZSE,"Great video and insightful view of the world. We can learn a lot about the world watching these videos. Your travel culture channel is an inspiration for me and my YouTube channel too, Talking Society, that is about travel, history and art things. I try to combine my hobby by travelling and learning about the history and the places I go. It's incredible"
2737,d2Dw-PuNZSE,Are the people on that island consider themselves as British ???
2738,d2Dw-PuNZSE,Not gonna mention the probability of the mass amount of paedophiles on the island. 😂
2739,d2Dw-PuNZSE,The Polynesians weren't shit! The vikings were the bad asses of the oceans!
2740,d2Dw-PuNZSE,Skull Island?
2741,d2Dw-PuNZSE,Does anyone know the name of that amazing looking fish they caught?
2742,d2Dw-PuNZSE,AMAZING STORY
2743,d2Dw-PuNZSE,"I appreciate that would like to shine a light on the positive aspects of places you visit. Leaving out the recent rapey history is your decision. Would it be rude to stay a few days with the main rapey family and be shown nice hospitality then leave the island and dog them by presenting a different narrative? You made a choice which is controversial for some people but whichever way you present it sometime would complain. For me this video seems hollow and awkward. The place is beautiful. You decided not to present the negative, yet the whole video basically boils down to a 1 min conversation in the shop. Looking at a rusty cannon, some carvings and a viewpoint. It's obvious the vibe is weird and seems like lots was left out or something. Please do a podcast and tell it how it really was."
2744,d2Dw-PuNZSE,"Fishes is not the word for plural fish, its just fish"
2745,VBGvwI3ATls,20:07 That hurt my heart; tears flowing with what some are doing.
2746,VBGvwI3ATls,It it wasn't dangerous I would've asked you to run with Lions in Africa.
2747,VBGvwI3ATls,I know about five people who have been bitten / attacked by a shark and I know know people who have been struck by lightning so...
2748,VBGvwI3ATls,"I can confidently say I have watched dozens of your films. This is more of an act of self-journalism than one of commenting for others to see. You’ve (the yes theory and seek discomfort brands/channels) helped me overcome my insatiable belief that being purely pragmatic is the way to live life. I’m pursuing a double major in of physics and computer science based off that belief. Now,  I plan to pursue this same double major for a different reason.

Beauty. 

Seeking discomfort is beautiful. It’s the act of letting yourself think freely, thinking about the thoughts that we typically disregard. I think we generally do this because we want to stay comfortable, we want to appease society/the people around us. We want to become a success in such a way that others deem us one. I think the main revelation I’ve come too is that if you’re doing things that legitimately make you happy, you’re doing the right things…and it’s beautiful.

Wonder

Experiencing wonder had been an uphill and downhill journey for me. I’ve always been a curious person, it’s led me to question commonly held beliefs and views of the world/universe. It’s led to my pragmatic mindset, it’s led me to believe that given enough questions and thought, you will always arrive at the correct answer. I have come to realize that it’s impossible for me to come to all the correct answers. However, the act of seeking all of them is beautiful beyond measure. The fact that we humans, made up of literal star dust have become capable of wondering about the universe we are part of is magnificent. Our lives are truly the universe seeking to understand itself, and that’s beautiful. That’s a life worth living. If you’re purely pragmatic, you’ll arrive at the conclusion that nothing really matters, and it’s hard, if not impossible, to prove that belief wrong with pure logic. With that in mind, realize we are living a life, one nearly inconceivably hard to explain and one we’re astronomically lucky to be a part of at this very moment in time; if genuinely coming to this realization isn’t beautiful and mind blowing, I’m not sure what would be. 

Takeaway 

If technically nothing matters, why not live a life of beauty and fulfillment. Although somewhat paradoxical, I think this gives life meaning. How could this not be the right answer to life. An answer that is right, but different for all."
2749,VBGvwI3ATls,Thank you for sharing!
2750,VBGvwI3ATls,This is beautiful and inspiring! To learn more about the damage the fishing industry does to our oceans please watch the documentary Seaspiracy. As individuals we can easily do so much to save our precious planet ❤
2751,VBGvwI3ATls,I was just thinking I was getting hungry for shark fin soup. 😋
2752,VBGvwI3ATls,"You can swim with great whites outside of cages, freedivers have done so and documented it on Guadalupe island"
2753,VBGvwI3ATls,me watching this eating a fin soup
2754,VBGvwI3ATls,"Humans are the most inhumane. We will never prosper if we don't all work together and with all animals and plants on this planet. We are so lucky to be on this earth, let's be grateful rather than greedy ❤"
2755,VBGvwI3ATls,You should come Fuvahmulah Island in Maldives to dive with tiger sharks 🦈
2756,VBGvwI3ATls,It’s literally 50/50 if you will get eaten or not.
2757,VBGvwI3ATls,"the problem is there are too many people :I wonder how we can fix that since covid was a testing phase for it, wonder what the big wigs will pull next?...."
2758,VBGvwI3ATls,Cannot ever fathom eating fish or contributing in anyway to the potential harm of these majestic creatures and countless others. Kill the demand not the animal.
2759,VBGvwI3ATls,"In average they say 70 shark attacks per year (fatal and non fatal,  I'm not too sure about that number of 439 fatal shark attacks you say in the video 😮)"
2760,VBGvwI3ATls,"Thanks for raising awareness on this matter. Its so important. 👍 for environmental content!

Ocean Ramsey is being criticized though for touching wild animals, namely sharks. 
They are not pets. And some of them have behaviours that not everybody knows. Like its not obvious from people when they sleep and when not. You can transmit harmful bacteria when touching them and unless they approach you, its simply not fine to touch them."
2761,VBGvwI3ATls,"I've always had an irrational fear of sharks, but plucked up the courage to snorkel on vacation last year knowing full well that there were lots of sharks in the area. They were timid and not too big, only 5-6 feet, but it felt good to overcome my fear! After seeing the first one and it darting off after hearing me scream, I was eager to see more!"
2762,VBGvwI3ATls,"They're so majestic. Thank you for sharing this video, YES Theory. Also, the cinematography of these underwater clips... truly stunning 😍✨🦈"
2763,VBGvwI3ATls,I always get so sad when I see futage like this reminding me of what we are doing to the ocean. Thank you for doing your part in bringing awareness. I also recomend the Netflix documentary Seaspiracy.
2764,VBGvwI3ATls,"Anyone can do travel videos but it will never be as good as what yes theory offers. It's you guys who made every video special, your personalities and showing your raw self to the audience❤"

2766,dTqVocrDoy0,"How did they get the supplies up there to build this cabin? Wow,🏔 what a feat!"
2767,dTqVocrDoy0,I'd be worried that the ropes to help you ascend are old and weathered and their integrity compromised....
2768,dTqVocrDoy0,I am gonna go there alone. Secretly
2769,dTqVocrDoy0,"I can't imagine having to live there every day with extreme loneliness, but if my food and drink needs and the internet are met, why not be able to live there... waaaoooe"
2770,dTqVocrDoy0,"AMAZING! Don showing up, what a stroke of luck! Am I the only one curious about the bathroom accommodations?"
2771,dTqVocrDoy0,Where did you pee and poop?
2772,dTqVocrDoy0,The path is not too dangerous nor difficult.. it is the lack of common sense and preparation by the idiots today
2773,dTqVocrDoy0,"The lookout is in WA, yet traveled through North Vancouver, CA ?"
2774,dTqVocrDoy0,"I know this is much later, but every article says camping at the summit is prohibited. Is this closure recent? I’ve been planning to do this hike but I’d love stay in the actually fire lookout. Or is there anyone I can contact about staying?"
2775,dTqVocrDoy0,Go Fish.  lol
2776,dTqVocrDoy0,THAT is an achievement.  Kudos
2777,dTqVocrDoy0,"You know, the funniest thing about watching this, is because my cousins did crazy shit like this decades ago. The question I ask, is why is your experience so special? I think that I know why, is that because we never had, ""Instant Knowledge Told By Live People!!!!!"""
2778,dTqVocrDoy0,dude get out of my house
2779,dTqVocrDoy0,"Walks out to get the kabobs, “To bad about the kobobs”😂😂😂😂😂"
2780,dTqVocrDoy0,I love anywhere other than the US
2781,dTqVocrDoy0,It's truly amazing how watching this makes someplace between my belly button and my butt hole do flip flops. I can't stop the feeling  have to not look  to stop it. Is that the fear of heights? The eyes really are connected to reactions in the body. Wonder what other connections are real? IF that feeling is a from watching a TV with you guys climbing a mountain you have really given seek discomfort a whole new meaning. For sure I felt discomfort watching this.Maybe seeking bravery  is better!
2782,dTqVocrDoy0,I could live in that lookout..
2783,dTqVocrDoy0,You guys all seem like pretty chill guys and great friends. One of the coolest things for me is how a random hiker could just join your groups and seem like he’s been there the whole time. I wish I had friends like this. Props for making this trek a reality!
2784,dTqVocrDoy0,This is one of them. But the lonest house is really in thr middle of the ocean.

We want to get to you! So if you want to help us to take the Project Iceman Film to your city you can do so by going to this link: www.theicemanfilm.com/bringing-the-film-to-you"
2786,-U97RoxfWpI,Just…. Wow 🤩 ❤❤❤❤❤😮
2787,-U97RoxfWpI,The way you wrote COPENGAN instead of COPENHAGEN cracks me. :D
2788,-U97RoxfWpI,"I didn't know what to expect when I watched the documentary.  I don't have words for it.  I cried at the end and all because of how his thoughts and feelings are so relatable.   It relates to everyone, everywhere, and it was truly amazing to watch his story.  I can't believe I hadn't heard of it until today, but I was so happy I watched it.   Keep doing what you're doing Yes Theory, we need people like you in our world.  

Anyone who has not seen this, it's a must watch.  It punched me in the gut being a mom to 2 boys close in age to Anton and his brother.  I want them to watch this documentary and see themselves doing what they dream of, doing what people say is not possible.  We do live in a world that unfortunately says there are limits to what a person can do if it's out of the ordinary.  There is no limit to what you can achieve if you want it enough.  Thank you for taking us on his journey."
2789,-U97RoxfWpI,Will it ever be released online?

2815,C7dbCrsf0l4,Very nice!
2816,C7dbCrsf0l4,I’ve watched a few of your videos and it’s strange to me that so far you’re never encountered any bad or hard times on your journeys…your videos seem highly scripted…I’ve read on several websites how annoying Americans are to Europeans by just saying hi to random people on the streets and yet you as a European claim that is your gateway to meeting people in different countries.
2817,C7dbCrsf0l4,"Just curious, how does passport control work for the crew of cargo ships?"

The man truly is a problem solver! On a personal note, I was scared to take on so much travel without Ammar as he’s working on our big Iceman of Antarctica documentary, so I’m really grateful for all the amazing support I’ve felt behind all of these recent stories whether through watching, commenting, liking the videos or going as far as repping Seek Discomfort clothing, it is all appreciated. Much love to you all and see you in September once we’re back from break!! 💕"

2839,_T2Avd3tFHc,Mikhail just got a short vacation with 3 sudden grandchildren ....the best that could happen

2879,bSs0o7DrHeg,Really thankful for your all.😍🇳🇵
2880,bSs0o7DrHeg,Im a beekeeper and this made me upset. Not that they take the honey.. but that they knocked down large slabs of comb that were filled with tens of thousands of new born bees that were ready to hatch within a few days. And those said slabs had ZERO honey on them! It was straight brood. They literally hindered honey production 10 fold for the future. They really must not know shit about how bees work. Ive been doing this for 14 years so i know what im talking about. No bees are different when it comes to building colonies.
2881,bSs0o7DrHeg,"Gota wonder. Who was rambling through that jungle long ago and looked up to notice bees coming from a hole on the cliff, and think...hmmmmm I am going to make a bamboo ladder and go up there to fetch me some honey?"

2888,Xhtc3EX12Z8,"#BADNEWS A survey shows that 94% of men who live over 100 are under 5ft10...So if your tall get life insurance.. finally, the short guy gets a win"

OH and hes 110
2890,Xhtc3EX12Z8,This makes me think of my grandpa. He passed away a little over a year ago at the age of 91. He was very close to being 100
2891,Xhtc3EX12Z8,It's so sweet how people are always trying their best to communicate with you guys in a language that is not theirs and how happy they seem to feed you and love you like they've known you forever. 😭😭😭 Human beings are great!
2892,Xhtc3EX12Z8,"How to live to a hundred yes theory pattern

2893,Xhtc3EX12Z8,My Grandmother passed away at 102 on her birthday 12/16/15  ☁️
2894,Xhtc3EX12Z8,The carcasses ruined it
2895,Xhtc3EX12Z8,Sounds like if you just speak Spanish you can pretty much communicate with Italians LOL
2896,Xhtc3EX12Z8,going out without a plan is the best! only if you are WHITE
2897,Xhtc3EX12Z8,manifesting a 100 yrs fulfilling life!
2898,Xhtc3EX12Z8,It's Italia - why would they speak English?
2899,Xhtc3EX12Z8,Come to Sardinia to visit us! Thanks for the amazing video!
2900,Xhtc3EX12Z8,Ikaria is in the blue zone ! Message me for more information. My grandma was born there and people are smoking cigarettes and drinking every day AT 100 YEARS OLD !! let me know if anyone wants tips
2901,Xhtc3EX12Z8,You should go back to Greece and check out IKARIA ! I have a lot of family on that island and we would love to introduce you to our family and culture! I promise you won’t be disappointed 🧿❤️
2902,dfxxtnUbODQ,"Don’t worry my friends, we’re already on another trip together and just filmed the most Yes Theory experience in Italy which only took us 2 hours by flight to get to, hence wanting to be in Europe :) we’re just finding a new home and elevated purpose ⚡️❤️ See you in 2 weeks for the adventure!"
2903,dfxxtnUbODQ,Sorry los Angeles is not part of the US . Glad you decided to leave and live your dream and have a greater impact in life
2904,dfxxtnUbODQ,You’re French? Some reason I thought you were Swedish.
2905,dfxxtnUbODQ,Because LA is a woke shithole?
2906,dfxxtnUbODQ,"Even with our bullshit leadership (Fuck Joe Biden) America is still the place of dreams coming true. Trump 2024. If he doesnt win, a new civil war will most likely start and when America is fighting amongst ourselves, another country will most likely attack us and start WW3 but id rather die as an American than live as a traitor or a pussy that ran away from conflict. Look at what this country has done for you and your channel. Dont you dare abandon this country now. You came here for a reason. Stand with us. America has done so much for you."
2907,dfxxtnUbODQ,Paris or L.A.? No brainer 🥰🫶🏻
2908,dfxxtnUbODQ,"Out of curiosity, is that apartment complex at the beginning the same place that while you were sleeping was filmed? It looks identical!"
2909,dfxxtnUbODQ,"Damn I watched since a long time, then stopped watching because I started to travel and explore myself. Now coming back to YesTheory and finding all these things out… interesting! Things change and time goes on."
2910,dfxxtnUbODQ,"My personal opinion is that the world needs you guys.  You are such a force for good, so I pray that you are still doing this into old age.  I just found out about Yes Theory yesterday, and I think that it's easily the find of the year.  Congrats on that apartment in France!"
2911,dfxxtnUbODQ,"It's like 3days that i found your channel (1st video-$10k taxi) and i had to watch more.. great time watching you guys, I m from Czech rep, so lots of videos are close of my livin... cant believe you never been in Prague.."
2912,dfxxtnUbODQ,"In going through Covid, we all sought discomfort by following the restricting rules for the benefit of the vulnerable."
2913,dfxxtnUbODQ,"Was wondering why your passports can take you anywhere almost without the need for a visa. But mine requires such. Who said it was supposed to be that way? So how can I travel the world? Can Ammar relate? I don't want to migrate. I'm happy where I am, with my wife. Why the status of being in a Third World country, and the need for a visa just to get around.  A distrust of the West with countries like ours?"
2914,dfxxtnUbODQ,Tom ! Je ne savais pas que tu étais français également 😍 Welcome back !
2915,dfxxtnUbODQ,This makes me emotional to watch 🥹
2916,dfxxtnUbODQ,"Ngl I shed a tear, thank you for the inspiration you have given me since I was a young teen. Your wisdom genuinely baffles me. I spent a while travelling and experienced the exact same feeling… I was ready to come home. Good luck with your next chapter x"
2917,dfxxtnUbODQ,"I love your channel. Pre & Post-CoVid. I disagree with most bc I prefer the newer posts. There is a maturity, depth, & thoughtfulness in them. It saddens me that there has been criticism of the newer format. Keep pressing on & thank you for showing us a life outside of ourselves by traveling the world. A dream many cannot ever achieve. ❤"
2918,dfxxtnUbODQ,"Man u guys give hope to all and inspire all generations,,, awesome stories and showin of many different cultures and prespectives...well done,,, blooms nz"
2919,dfxxtnUbODQ,"Guys, 
I just want to tell you to do things which will make you happy, not just for the viewers."
2920,dfxxtnUbODQ,Y'all are doing just fine. Keep carrying the fire. ;)
2921,dfxxtnUbODQ,Jesus is the way the truth and the life !!! Only Jesus can fill that missing part of the heart! ❤
2922,DTYuoHcLB5A,"if you are living in complete darkness for 5 days, you can't open your eyes so smoothly. Glare of daylight would blind your eyes for some seconds."
2923,DTYuoHcLB5A,If it is fully dark why there is shadow and what are those 3 bright lights? I did not understand.
2924,DTYuoHcLB5A,"This conclusion perspect is so enlightened, is so true!"
2925,DTYuoHcLB5A,"this is amazing, i hate complete darkness"
2926,DTYuoHcLB5A,I have done a 5 days retreat in a darkroom and seriously  it is impossible to go straight from dark to light  without transition. Our eyes cannot support that. I am wandering  how Amar could do that.
2927,DTYuoHcLB5A,"This is not dark retreat, if u can see the shadow & bulb?"
2928,DTYuoHcLB5A,Minute 7:40 relatable
2929,DTYuoHcLB5A,"Im here for Pat Mahomes! Cuz dude had to ""Pat His Home"" to get around😂😂"
2930,DTYuoHcLB5A,"Hi Ammara, I'm Alison, the female you! 😅"
2931,DTYuoHcLB5A,If he was in a completely dark room.. Why is there so many objects in the room castin shadows. If theres dark there wont be shadows like this.... Someone try explain this.
2932,DTYuoHcLB5A,My Jesus Mercy
2933,DTYuoHcLB5A,I would love for someone to explain to me how there is shadows if he is in total darkness
2934,DTYuoHcLB5A,"Amazing! I just have one point to make, I am a bit worried that these sponsorships will ruin the content in the long run. I have an instinct to mistrust content with adverts in them as they feel less genuine. I am a much bigger fan of Patreon like systems that are more free from negative incentives.
Anyway move love and keep doing great things!"
2935,DTYuoHcLB5A,@14:51 Borat reference 😂
2936,DTYuoHcLB5A,maybe im missing something or dont understand but why is there soo many shadows in complete darkness?
2937,DTYuoHcLB5A,"Guys, only God can fill this emptiness in ur hearts. Caz how fish cannot without water and trees without land so we cannot live without God. That's how He created us. So I wish you to know this joy and be truly happy !"
2938,DTYuoHcLB5A,But as human you need to see daylight for the vitamines right?
2939,DTYuoHcLB5A,This is cool and all but does no one see the lights in the video lol like theirs little lights all over.. which may not be strong and LED or something so he can see slightly where things are. But i don't get why hes then touching his way around when he can clearly see? 15:18 for example
2940,DTYuoHcLB5A,Nah he was doing way to much for the camera.
2941,DTYuoHcLB5A,You can just travel to Northern Norway in the winter 😉
2942,OrJ4rPSlrlI,I didn't see one woman
2943,OrJ4rPSlrlI,Lawless state haha. Is it a hospitalless state also? What do they do when they get sick ? I bet they go to Denmark.
2944,OrJ4rPSlrlI,"No laws but you are forbidden from film, my friends that sound very much like a law lol, the irony."
2945,OrJ4rPSlrlI,I loved yes theory and I would like a show u do bs
2946,OrJ4rPSlrlI,I would like to congratulate drugs for winning the war on drugs
2947,OrJ4rPSlrlI,"So much freedom you turn north korea..
What kind of state of lawlessness when you can’t even make a video…? I do what I wanna do!! Now that’s lawless"
2948,OrJ4rPSlrlI,"I love Danish people, but you could probably annex this town with 500 people."
2949,OrJ4rPSlrlI,I'm curious to know how you can be a President and land owner in an anarchist society.
2950,OrJ4rPSlrlI,FINLAND!!!
2951,OrJ4rPSlrlI,"Free place but ""you can't film in here"". Do we see the irony? 😂"
2952,OrJ4rPSlrlI,Thank you!!!!
2953,OrJ4rPSlrlI,"""Last free place"" in Europe where you are not allowed to film.....hahahaha."
2954,OrJ4rPSlrlI,The irony of free land with no laws yet you aren't allowed to film. 🤦‍♂️
2955,OrJ4rPSlrlI,Strong will? No these are societal losers who cannot find any discipline in themselves to make an effort
2956,OrJ4rPSlrlI,"I went to Christiania a year ago. That place absolutely opened my eyes. It was just so beautiful and creative. I was mesmerized by the cute garden decoarations, all these colorful pots, even painted shoes or bicycles were used there as deco. My other friends were there just for the thrill of it but I have found that place oddly beatiful. I agree,  it's not for everyone and I would not advice anyone to just wander around alone, but I am just so grateful to you guys to break once again the stereotypical thinking. This place is so much more than just ""a place to get drugs"" or something."
2957,OrJ4rPSlrlI,"watching this video gives me hope for humanity, then i go to the comments and immediately lose that hope"
2958,OrJ4rPSlrlI,"I love your videos, but this is just stupid to me. It's just a hippie neighborhood in Copenhagen. Lawless but gets rated every day by police?"
2959,OrJ4rPSlrlI,"Everything ist allowed: ""what the fuck are you doing?"""
2960,OrJ4rPSlrlI,"A free city, but you can't shoot videos on the street."
2961,OrJ4rPSlrlI,How is it forbidden there to make a video in chridtisnia when there are no laws
2962,lGpQgxP_o-Q,Watch Now at www.theicemanfilm.com!
2963,lGpQgxP_o-Q,This is insane.... Superb production team and documentary..
2964,lGpQgxP_o-Q,Please opload project iceman movie on youtube
2965,lGpQgxP_o-Q,❤❤❤❤
2966,lGpQgxP_o-Q,"I love this so much. I paid to watch the doc when it first came out, and I can’t wait to rewatch when it ultimately comes out on YT❤

P.S. the music choice of “The Way” with the emotional cinematography and narration here is just spine tingling. I come back to rewatch this trailer just for the way it makes me feel 🫡"
2967,lGpQgxP_o-Q,Where can I watch this movie?
2968,lGpQgxP_o-Q,Just watched the movie! Highly recommended! Reminded me of 14 peaks! 🔥👌🏼
2969,lGpQgxP_o-Q,I didnt know there was no timeframe to complete it... he slept 23 hours... and then did the rest of the run. I bet i could finished it in a week too.
2970,lGpQgxP_o-Q,I've just seen it
2971,lGpQgxP_o-Q,so how about the camera man?is he a AI?
2972,lGpQgxP_o-Q,This looks like BBC Wildlife documentary quality. Absolutely going to watch this.
2973,lGpQgxP_o-Q,reg the  taxi driver sent me
2974,lGpQgxP_o-Q,"This is incredible! 
It's insane how far you all went to accomplish this. ❤"
2975,lGpQgxP_o-Q,I like yes theory but do they really expect people to pay $16.50 for a documentary? They already make millions from ads. Pure greed. I can watch a movie at the cinema cheaper.
2976,lGpQgxP_o-Q,"""A man who suffers before it is necessary, suffers more than is necessary."" Lucius Annaeus Seneca"
2977,lGpQgxP_o-Q,https://youtu.be/VaMjhwFE1Zw The Real Iceman
2978,lGpQgxP_o-Q,cuanto cuesta perrillos?
2979,lGpQgxP_o-Q,This came across as potentially tv/cinema grade I feel :)
2980,lGpQgxP_o-Q,WOW.
2981,lGpQgxP_o-Q,"I just watched the full movie and I went back to this. There's so much more to just being a documentary. I feel myself being elevated by every bit of it; the story, the shots, the crew, the struggles, etc. Each contributing to make it profound and genuinely moving. It's a masterpiece! Congratulations!"

2983,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,Sometimes I wonder why the ancient Yakutskian people didn't move to the south? Or they just didn't know that it's warmer in the south?
2984,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,"These people seem like they’re truly authentic and genuine people, true to their culture and traditions. My life spent mostly in SE Asia has shown to me that Asian culture, especially in SE Asia, is so fake. People only do it because they’re supposed to do it and they’re very good at talking the talk but they only walk the walk WHEN others are present. Asians could truly learn from these people."
2985,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,I used to go to the Russian Bathhouses and from the sauna to ice bath repeatedly for hours. I became addicted to it and loved it. I’d stay in the bath for 5 to 7 minutes and it made me feel so high. I would get out laughing smiling and feeling so amazing. I miss it!
2986,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,I was born and bred in rural Yakut village. Miss my childhood so much ❤
2987,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,Махтал
2988,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,"Wow Guys… I just discovered your channel. It's a relief to see that the world out there is completely different than what we're told. People around the world are basically good people, helpful and friendly and not what we are told. Thank you for your work!"
2989,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,"sitting at home with a broken ankle. I am a restless world traveller and appreciate your cool videos. Gives me peace to watch and dream about my next adventure. My kids start to watch you guys too. Hope they will be even more inspired to travel. Thanks Team, you are awesome. Watching your adventures is keeping my spirits up. Come to New Zealand."
2990,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,It was today that I learned -40c=-40f
2991,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,"magical, welcoming, worthy."
2992,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,"I love the group together, sad Ammar couldn’t go but just want him to know that he is very loved ❤"
2993,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,amazing!
2994,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,"19:00. 
She got me good right there. 
Honestly not keen on the word ‘inspire’. It’s used to frequently these days, however, possibly for the first time in my life … I’m inspired. I can only pray to leave these word ‘full’. Amen to you all x"
2995,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,"Thomas the 900s was the 10th century lol not the 9th. That being said, the 1600s was the 17th century lol not the 16th.

2998,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,I absolutely loved this one!
2999,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,"Yakutia is such an amazing place, so beautiful nature there and such wonderful and hospitable people. I was lucky to go there a few times some years ago and still have great friends there. I really hope I can go again some time in the future."
3000,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,I can’t wait to pledge on the next project you guys do!
3001,8o8EzSwIZ6Q,"These people cannot be broken.
It’s better for the West not to get involved in places where they don’t understand anything."
3002,kYMZP2vXYqQ,All west fault... using ukraine for natos gain
3003,kYMZP2vXYqQ,I early agr for you. But after this video - say 1 world. Sankyou! You are cool team! 😮😊

3005,kYMZP2vXYqQ,"If you really believed in humanity, you would be in GAZA border now.
But you don't.
you are milking the conflict"
3006,kYMZP2vXYqQ,"hilarious how these YouTubers never mentioned the n4zis in ukraine, those specifically azov n4zis soldiers . And the corruption of their government, 2023 and im sure they have a different point of view. And looking at what Israel is doing in gaza, Putin is a saint compared to israel t3rr0rists."
3007,kYMZP2vXYqQ,Will you go to Egypt where the Rafah crossing from Gaza goes to?
3008,kYMZP2vXYqQ,Rabid Fox

3010,kYMZP2vXYqQ,"Words can’t describe how thankful we are for the help we’ve received from all around the world…After experiencing the horrors of war you kinda lose faith in humanity but seeing this, and how much people actually care for you and your people is so inspiring and healing actually…So thank you,all of you out there for making this world better 🤍 We,our children and many generations to come will always remember your kindness and support. And a big thank you to Yes Theory for documenting this moment in our history 🙏 Big love from Ukraine 🩵💛 
Слава Україні!"
3011,kYMZP2vXYqQ,Hypocrisy
3012,kYMZP2vXYqQ,"Not month's hundreds of years( And thanks you, it is very important"
3013,kYMZP2vXYqQ,I came to watch this after I saw Amar IG story post just now. With War going on in gaza. Don't forget to make a go fund me for Gazan pple. I have been yes theory for sometimes. And I hope there would be no double standard here.
3014,kYMZP2vXYqQ,Do something for Palestine!!! You did for Ukraine!  Palestinian childrens lives matter! The people matter please care about them!
3015,kYMZP2vXYqQ,Where’s the the coverage about PAL3_STIN3 ? Not even a IG Story post?
3016,kYMZP2vXYqQ,"What we as people from other countries have to understand these folks are coming to our country for help. Nothing more, some of their family didn't make it. Out but believe me when I say they want nothing more than to go back home. They are good people they are Strong people, and they want nothing more than to go home, and we need to help them"
3017,kYMZP2vXYqQ,Glory to Ukraine and  all.her heroes
3018,kYMZP2vXYqQ,"Why do you delete my comment???? I’m screen recording this!!!

3022,ZOgVZCugeuo,Hey... If you've made it until the end... The continuation you're looking for is right here on this channel :)
3023,ZOgVZCugeuo,What happen Eric?
3024,ZOgVZCugeuo,Some people are lucky.
3025,ZOgVZCugeuo,Very nice!
3026,ZOgVZCugeuo,"Tommy kind of looks like Sal from Impractical Jokers. 

Now, awesome idea but I thought the challenge was to get someone to buy you a plane ticket to get out of the Airport… and go the farthest. Begging for money from several people, even getting people to Venmo you money, seems unfair and cheating. That’s way different than getting someone to buy you a ticket!"
3027,ZOgVZCugeuo,I vote for the one who didn't go to Hawaii the other one at airport got seek discomfort
3028,ZOgVZCugeuo,Eric giving Ferris Bueller energy
3029,ZOgVZCugeuo,Asian people and people that have experienced hardships are so kind
3030,ZOgVZCugeuo,I've watched about 652 Yes Theory videos and this is my favorite one
3031,ZOgVZCugeuo,Thanks!
3032,ZOgVZCugeuo,"Guy in airport name Ryan 5:43  , but guy who is transfer money is Robert 6:14 . Can you explain?

For a channel which peddles spontanity and encourages simpletons to do wild goose chases, scripted shows are a BIG NO NO ... shame on you ..."
3033,ZOgVZCugeuo,"I think the best trip go,s too tommy because i think costa rica is so mutch more beautyfull"
3034,ZOgVZCugeuo,hey just wanted you guys to know i've gotten two anti-lgbtq ads and anti-trans ads on your videos :( idk if you can block these types of ads but i wanted to let you know.
3035,ZOgVZCugeuo,"I've never flown first class... but that first class looks pretty average, looks more like business class or even a top airline's premium economy...."
3036,ZOgVZCugeuo,There’s something so funny about a man reclining his chair into a bed on an airplane in first class with a shirt that reads ”seek discomfort”. Ironic yet iconic.
3037,ZOgVZCugeuo,💚💚💚
3038,ZOgVZCugeuo,Feels staged. Something ain't right. Actors would get it.
3039,ZOgVZCugeuo,"Wow, being stuck with the guy in Hawai would be terrible,"
3040,ZOgVZCugeuo,I think hes waiting for you in vegas😆
3041,ZOgVZCugeuo,"Seek contact with the Ukrainian guy to give him 100$ please, he deserves it."

3045,H4jA_SN4hgg,Puppy!
3046,H4jA_SN4hgg,Guys it's a cold December night. It's drizzling now and making a sweet rythm as the water is dropping upon the plants in my balcony. I'm sitting here and enjoying this little thing. I'm wearing shorts and super cold but I don't want to leave this surreal moment of discomfort. The cold gentle breeze is telling me that it's worth living in this beautiful world.

3055,H4jA_SN4hgg,"As a conservative American I'm appalled by my midwest brothers who wish to slaughter our wolves. STOP, if you are a rancher, if you are a dairy farmer, ect. LET'S figure it out. DON'T FUCKING tell me you need to blow them away, I live out here so don't blow smoke up my ass."
3056,H4jA_SN4hgg,Have been following them for awhile. Just an amazing story and what a dream to live there with a family like that. Wolves were man’s best friends until the domestic breeding then into hunting. Saves the wolves!!!🐺
3057,H4jA_SN4hgg,"I've just watched a documentary on Bhutan and added a comment related to dreams of adopting their ways only to watch this.. i don't know what it is about humans that allow them to act so entitled.  You can still have everything and do relatively no harm, (because everything has a cost) so I'm feeling bewildered and so saddened by what we have become 😢"
3058,H4jA_SN4hgg,These are mid to upper content wolfdogs.
3059,H4jA_SN4hgg,"Magnificent!
People who want to kill wolves are … how to say … fuqed in da hed"
3060,H4jA_SN4hgg,peapole just want to kill every wolf on world (btw once when someone was chasing me i got saved by wolfes)
3061,H4jA_SN4hgg,You guys are incredible! Thank you for bringing out such important subjects such as this and for giving a voice to such amazing beautiful beings who cannot speak for themselves. You truly are making a difference in the world 🙏
3062,hTyNa_KO_0A,"We’re back! And… what.. a strange adventure.. We honestly got quite close to not sharing this after filming it but after sitting on this footage for a while we decided to release it. Our friend @LexieLimitless told us about this place a few years ago after she already went to visit. She came with us to help us capture this unique experience, and we recommend checking her channel out if you haven’t already :) https://www.youtube.com/c/LexieLimitless"
3063,hTyNa_KO_0A,So the drawing with the  stick were perfect compare to what exactly?
3064,hTyNa_KO_0A,There's one of these in Colorado but I can't tell you about it
3065,hTyNa_KO_0A,Lots of beautiful art but the culty aspects of this and attempts to access secret knowledge and speak with other versions of your self or something all pretty much just seem like satanism lol.
3066,hTyNa_KO_0A,looks like a cult
3067,hTyNa_KO_0A,"Well - bizarre is the word that rightly comes to mind.
Also the feeling of being tired coming out of one of this bizarre rooms shows what is going on: A sucking of life energy, not a contribution to it.
Thank you, @steadyinthelight, for providing the hint to some reports of victims.
I suspected as much but was not able to find anything. 
What I saw in numerous videos about this flytrap is bad art, lightshows, some mystery-fairy-tales (dug it by hand, police was awed,...) and a lot of smiling faces from inmates who have to smile, or else...
Just another example of how to exploit naive and optimistic people who want to experience something entitely different.
Well - not so much. It's the same old same. Exploitation in EVERY possible way and no easy way out (at least after some years of brainwash and coercing).
Beware.
Think."
3068,hTyNa_KO_0A,Who knew Italians had such powerful drugs. 😅
3069,hTyNa_KO_0A,Witchcraft.
3070,hTyNa_KO_0A,"Another charlatan machine time is nothing except evaporating shroom room , another cult"
3071,hTyNa_KO_0A,Cult came straight to my mind.
3072,hTyNa_KO_0A,The way they have designed their houses is unbelieveable. I would love to live their someday.
3073,hTyNa_KO_0A,"With so many LEDs and lights in use, my biggest question would be. What's your electricity bill like?"
3074,hTyNa_KO_0A,I think Thomas could really benefit from some psychedelics. And this would make a great episode!
3075,hTyNa_KO_0A,Wow! I loved this video guys!!
3076,hTyNa_KO_0A,Why are you guys promoting a literal cult?
3077,hTyNa_KO_0A,"Excuse me ma'am, just how much crack have y'all been smoking here?"
3078,hTyNa_KO_0A,"these places are so dangerous. You feel amazed at first, curiosity will tell you to get more information and they will show everything and won't fail to amaze you. Once you develop personal relationships with some of their members, you will feel inclined to spend more time with them. If they offer you solutions for all of your basic needs (like food, sleep, health, friends and sex) your inner logic would tell you to stay because there is nothing more you could wish to have. But what you should never lose remain in control of your own life is the curiosity for other lifestyles. Once you think you found the perfect place and the perfect people, you are too easy to control and people with harming intent will sooner or later abuse you for their purposes. It might not be harming for you at first but then other people will catch on to use you until their needs are satisfied. If then power becomes centralized and then belongs to one person, the destructive power because too big to handle. This is how dictatorship is created. Eventually it will be destroyed but on that path many people will suffer unbearably."
3079,hTyNa_KO_0A,"I never comment but I found this video very interesting, deja vu is a thing and I believe we know the future through our dreams. I once had a dream of my teacher at the time telling us a story I remembered the color of his tie and suit and our lesson of the day. He typically tells us stories and they’re different every-time except this time I knew the story. I looked over at my table mates asking if he had already told this story and they told me no, I was so sure he had told this story before that I began to tell the story verbatim as he was telling the story. Everyone was shocked including my teacher, I was so weirded out and it really opens up that anything is possible. I have deja vu often and in times when it is happening if I was not satisfied with the result I had made previously I change it."
3080,hTyNa_KO_0A,"It's basically what every cult / religion should be, but less than half a percent ever is"
3081,hTyNa_KO_0A,It looks like an interesting place and somewhere I would like to spend time if I  could.
3082,utYwOcpKSr8,Thank you so much for traveling with us at Safarisource! Our Maasai chief guide Loserian loved hosting you on safari and taking Peter to his village was a highlight for us and Loserian's family. We at Safarisource look forward to welcoming the Yes Theory and Seek Discomfort community to future African adventures.
3083,utYwOcpKSr8,"thanks for taking us along the ride. we have those tarts in asia--hong kong, macau, china. they call them custard tarts and some are portuguese style...i forgot what they add to it that makes them portuguese style...but that's so cool seeing it in lisbon.

3101,utYwOcpKSr8,this video is like a movie. a very good movie
3102,WTT7XZko3qk,Yes Theory MUST already know that the CIA is responsible for thousands and maybe hundreds of thousands of murders in America and around the world… including the assassination of JFK…. 😅 🤔
3103,WTT7XZko3qk,Impressive drone shots!
3104,WTT7XZko3qk,"This guy is a good charismatic salesman/actor I'll give him that, but he's no ex-CIA spook."
3105,WTT7XZko3qk,Seems like he’s just a professional stunts guy
3106,WTT7XZko3qk,"I am very happy I watched this video, I learned so much lol"
3107,WTT7XZko3qk,"7:10

3110,WTT7XZko3qk,"To see the pure joy on their faces when they completed the 180 turn is amazing 😂 

Growing up on a farm in the prairies we were doing those when we were 10 in an old ass Lincoln town car, fully unsupervised haha sounds made up but I’m not sure how we all made it out of our childhoods but here I am!"
3111,WTT7XZko3qk,Tommy's J-Turn was impeccable lol
3112,WTT7XZko3qk,Try the sas 3day  escape and evade test or  spend 72hrs  on a island in the south Atlantic sea or  swim with dolphins or de mining in Ukrainian or in former Yugoslavia  or  72 hours in Vlad the Impaler s castle in transilvania  or  Estonia or  Poland  or other EU countries

3117,WTT7XZko3qk,Not even 100 year olds pee that often. That seems more like a serious medical condition
3118,WTT7XZko3qk,This brought back Army SERE school memories
3119,WTT7XZko3qk,why does eric look like crazy-8 from breaking bad and better call saul
3120,WTT7XZko3qk,"He said, Hey buddy give me all your money LOLOL"
3121,WTT7XZko3qk,Tommy jumping out of the trunk ❤ legend
3122,ooNoZm_RG9A,THANK YOU FOR WATCHING ALL THE WAY TO THIS THIRD PART! This was the most challenging adventure with strangers Ammar has had and we’re so grateful with how it closed. Cannot wait for literally one of you watching right now to go on that trip… 😱
3123,ooNoZm_RG9A,You broke your own rule in the final trade; not to trade with anyone who knows Yes Theory...
3124,ooNoZm_RG9A,I'm really confused. The next episode is supposed to be surprising a stranger to take them to kilamanjaro but it ends up being a totally different trip.. unrelated to what's been talked about in this episode.... 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔
3125,ooNoZm_RG9A,Did anyone even win this
3126,ooNoZm_RG9A,"Say yes to life.
Romans 10:9-10🙏"
3127,ooNoZm_RG9A,Only ammar could make this happen
3128,ooNoZm_RG9A,I don’t think the videos are fake
3129,ooNoZm_RG9A,Be Ricky 🎉
3130,ooNoZm_RG9A,Ricky's nice but it's also a public stunt for him with millions of people watching.
3131,ooNoZm_RG9A,I feel like it would've been much easier if he used fb marketplace or something similar online lol
3132,ooNoZm_RG9A,Dang am i too late to enter the trip 😭
3133,ooNoZm_RG9A,Did he break his own rule and traded the expedition for a plane ticket...
3134,ooNoZm_RG9A,"I know this is old, but.. You broke your own rule again. You traded the Kilimanjaro trip to someone you know (who is obviously familiar with Yes Theory)."
3135,ooNoZm_RG9A,"great video, also listening to British people makes my day"
3136,ooNoZm_RG9A,how fake is this xd
3137,ooNoZm_RG9A,"""This is why people think you're videos are fake"" 😂"
3138,ooNoZm_RG9A,Ricky is an absolute Legend!
3139,ooNoZm_RG9A,Hey would you guys be interested in a hitchhiking race around HWY1 of Australia.....my best is 12 days
3140,ooNoZm_RG9A,“Rejections are redirections” wow maybe you just blew my mind
3141,ooNoZm_RG9A,Didn't he break the third rule trading with Brian? SMH start all over again! xD
3142,SXK2hCRkkiU,Who wants to trade?
3143,SXK2hCRkkiU,Jackets! Does anyone know where amar 8:08 got his jacket from? 😂
3144,SXK2hCRkkiU,I'll trade you my life for the girl at 12:24
3145,SXK2hCRkkiU,wow
3146,SXK2hCRkkiU,"""Rejection is just redirection.""

I'm genuinely putting that on my list of inspirational quotes."
3147,SXK2hCRkkiU,Rudy and his girl have an amazing apartment!
3148,SXK2hCRkkiU,"Rudy, what a beautiful dude. Great couple ❤"
3149,SXK2hCRkkiU,Where did y’all get those HIDEOUS umbrellas? Holy shit that’s the tackiest and ugliest thing you guys have ever been filmed with.
3150,SXK2hCRkkiU,Thumbnail need to be changed to something like: Ammar’s hardest challenge ever! … because this was tough… but you did it!!!
3151,SXK2hCRkkiU,The tube ... Last place on earth anyone would ever trade with you  🤣
3152,SXK2hCRkkiU,I can't believe you was at my teams stadium! I've been watching your channel for around 5 years now and have some Seek Discomfort clothes. I'm a season ticket holder there and was at that game as well! Wish I knew you was there! If you're ever back in London and want to go to the game I will be happy to take you. Love the channel guys keep it up!
3153,SXK2hCRkkiU,"Rejection is just redirection
I LOVE that!!!"
3154,SXK2hCRkkiU,What was Rudy's nationality?
3155,SXK2hCRkkiU,what an amazing person and boyfriend rudy was
3156,SXK2hCRkkiU,ryan copy this but modified it better
3157,SXK2hCRkkiU,jacket @9:22  where is that from?  I know it's 9 months later and low chance you ever see this but I would trade something awesome for it.  (the one you're wearing)
3158,SXK2hCRkkiU,"""rejection is just redirection"" - love that. :)"
3159,SXK2hCRkkiU,RUDY IS A LEGEND
3160,SXK2hCRkkiU,"if he would have not lost that cord  , would ammar  have met that dude its awsome how the universe works to help the yes theory"
3161,SXK2hCRkkiU,When I visit London next I’m knocking on there door for appreciation
3162,n-plDav_iIE,"That's fake and only happ to certain ppl , and it never goes to ppl who really need it like esp me my company flew me out to San Francisco to pick up and drive all the way to new York and it's been the best trip I ever had and the only one leaving me wanting to travel more but no break and def broke because I want to go to Bangladesh, so enjoy it guys while you still can,🤩😉"
3163,n-plDav_iIE,aww the pawshake from the dog was the cutest thing ever
3164,n-plDav_iIE,Ammar's energy ❤❤❤just wow
3165,n-plDav_iIE,Should have had an “have you heard of the paper club challenge?” counter hahaha
3166,n-plDav_iIE,The cig trade would have been amazing. The things people will give up for 1 cig is incredible
3167,n-plDav_iIE,"""the unthinkable happened""
""its raining"""
3168,n-plDav_iIE,"But first he needed a paperclip, lmao"
3169,n-plDav_iIE,"Balenciaga , never gonna forget."
3170,n-plDav_iIE,"""byeee"" ... rude asf"
3171,n-plDav_iIE,Soooo...did he just keep the expensive wallet?
3172,n-plDav_iIE,The Taxi Boy ripped you up
3173,n-plDav_iIE,Wait but thats an expensive wallet. If they didn't use it did they return it??
3174,n-plDav_iIE,the power bank to wallet trade was sus af.
3175,n-plDav_iIE,"Seems that wallet was too tempting to pass up. You don't ""forget"" a rule like that."
3176,n-plDav_iIE,Super resilienced Ammar. What a lesson you gave.
3177,n-plDav_iIE,Hope they give the guy his wallet back
3178,n-plDav_iIE,'i like hard things'
3179,n-plDav_iIE,Passive income is the only way to become millionaire... work on your passive income streams .... a fellow creator
3180,n-plDav_iIE,"I get that he felt sorry for breaking a rule, but couldn't you have traded the wallet for something slightly cheaper? Felt like that the guy from the wallet made a useless sacrifice by giving away his expensive wallet"
3181,n-plDav_iIE,Ppl making sarcastic offers are annoying af
3182,D_ncku6A7iA,"Hey. Been watching your videos for days now and I love it I just want to add can you include in your videos topics like what people do in those places, what they do for a living, do they have schools their, does it have a mayor or someone governing, cost of living, how much are the hotels or food that you it, it those sorts of things. Thanks."
3183,D_ncku6A7iA,"O vídeo em ""selfie"" é horrível. Quem assiste ao vídeo não está interessado na pessoa que o faz mas sim no ambiente que ele quer mostrar. Outra coisa que também não ajuda é a rapidez com que a câmara é movimentada. Outro mau hábito é o de colocar no vídeo música de fundo pois se a pessoa quiser ouvir música o Youtube tem milhares de vídeos."
3184,D_ncku6A7iA,I'd love to hear the stories of someone who actually lived there.
3185,D_ncku6A7iA,Can we buy a building there ? Is it possible? 🤔
3186,D_ncku6A7iA,https://www.youtube.com/@CeciliaBlomdahl
3187,D_ncku6A7iA,"Me: That guy doesn't look well dressed for the weather
Me: A canadian who never dresses properly for the cold weather."
3188,D_ncku6A7iA,I couldn't imagine what it felt like going through this place.
3189,D_ncku6A7iA,"tur nebija spoku pilseta,tur expermentus meginaja vai vairak"
3190,D_ncku6A7iA,here coms movei also i liked
3191,D_ncku6A7iA,It is bad idea to make films about traveling in devils country. Russia is a terrorist state. They kill people and children. It is better to ignore it at least.
3192,D_ncku6A7iA,Love your content. Guys you need to make vido about Dyatlov Pass incident.
3193,D_ncku6A7iA,how much money they spend to build this ghost town. like this depressing town is every where left by ussr inside out russia. just imagine how much money at that time at these places. rich but poor
3194,D_ncku6A7iA,Love the cinematic
3195,D_ncku6A7iA,That mosaic WoW!!!
3196,D_ncku6A7iA,I can watch Yes Theory the whole day
3197,D_ncku6A7iA,"Fantastic video, loved every minute 🙌🏽"
3198,D_ncku6A7iA,The videographer and editor of this content deserve a raise.
3199,D_ncku6A7iA,Your channel is fascinating ❤
3200,D_ncku6A7iA,"It would be figuratively frozen in time, not literally.  Just a member of the overuse and wrong use of literally popping my head in here"
3201,D_ncku6A7iA,"You can make a nice Horror Movie here .  With some Vampires or some wild killer wolf pack .
Imagine taking some LSD here and having a bad trip"
3202,m0vIzYjLw5Q,SERBIA...go to serbia pls.
3203,m0vIzYjLw5Q,Every king was once a baby; but how do you figure every building was once a blueprint? Do you realize that we have buildings on planet earth that are older than written languages in the area. Buildings get improvised without blueprints or plans all the time.
3204,m0vIzYjLw5Q,Fun fact there’s actually a YouTuber that lives in Svalbard it’s a good channel. https://youtube.com/@CeciliaBlomdahl?si=0F4UKCYxhDLmOcSo
3205,m0vIzYjLw5Q,Wow another big proof that authorities can be the biggest mthrfckrs in the world. It fills my heart with so much joy watching these young people travelling around the world with love and respect to other human beings regardless of anything. Way to go fellas! I love your channel!
3206,m0vIzYjLw5Q,"AHMAR, YES THEORY FAM YOU GUYS DESERVE THE WORLD"
3207,m0vIzYjLw5Q,"Anurag, you are a hero and an amazing person.
I say this from the bottom of my heart to the person who tried deporting Ammar: Eat shit, you miserable human being."
3208,m0vIzYjLw5Q,What's the purpose of deporting someone to a place they've never even lived before versus where they actually live? I don't get it
3209,m0vIzYjLw5Q,Covid was a scam. Poor dude
3210,m0vIzYjLw5Q,You guys are brilliant thanks ❤
3211,m0vIzYjLw5Q,Umm not to be the elephant in the room here but ... How did the guy in Germany make it to Svalbard first when you guys were in Norway?  Cause you didn't ask him to leave same day and meet you there untill after all your vaccine and immigration crap was fixed.  Just saying 🤔
3212,m0vIzYjLw5Q,Did u know  Norway s name is norge  in Norwegian  and I wish uncud wisit the smal town of vestby  in Norway
3213,m0vIzYjLw5Q,the power of the yes fam! always turn to family they always have your back!
3214,m0vIzYjLw5Q,Cha gaye Anurag bhaiyya! Jio..
3215,m0vIzYjLw5Q,That pharmacist was a legend
3216,m0vIzYjLw5Q,that yes fam member who converted it is such a w ngl
3217,m0vIzYjLw5Q,stop with adverts i paid premium from a reason
3218,m0vIzYjLw5Q,"Most northerly community in the world with 5k inhabitants is Barrow, Alaska"
3219,m0vIzYjLw5Q,Noone party like Norwegians. And I hate it. But this video was fun😂
3220,m0vIzYjLw5Q,So glad the Yes fam came through for Ammar!!
3221,m0vIzYjLw5Q,Wtf is this that they don't accept american vaccinations? That's so stupid
3222,gRszqN6rHE8,After finally being able to enter Europe.. Ammar decided to he wanted to see.. ALL of Paris on this crazy physical challenge.. What a way to celebrate his ability to travel :D
3223,gRszqN6rHE8,"Google Pixel... Yeah, they made you Google PIXEL out everything.

Seriously though, you didn't want to decline the sponsor? This blur is really annoying..."
3224,gRszqN6rHE8,"do a half marathon in Ladakh, India or participate in the annual Ladakh marathon"
3225,gRszqN6rHE8,Why is there so much pixilation? Even Ammars hand is pixelated.
3226,gRszqN6rHE8,sitting down constantly while running just makes cramps and things worse.
3227,gRszqN6rHE8,💚
3228,gRszqN6rHE8,Ammar's is always inspiring ❤ his personality is so down to earth
3229,gRszqN6rHE8,Slap some energizer bunny ears on Ammar.
3230,gRszqN6rHE8,Amazing!! Way to go Ammar!!
3231,gRszqN6rHE8,Why all the blurs on every little brand name.
3232,gRszqN6rHE8,"When you get sponsored by a company to promote their product, at least don't use the competitor's product in the same video or don't accept sponsorship at all. Do you even realize how these blurred circles are ruining viewers' experience?"
3233,gRszqN6rHE8,Love how the camera operator is supportive and right there along with Amar. Great job. :)
3234,gRszqN6rHE8,Why was so much blurred in this video???
3235,gRszqN6rHE8,Running to the moon! Woo Hoo!
3236,gRszqN6rHE8,Literally blurred everyone and everyone out lol
3237,gRszqN6rHE8,Ammar flipping the bird to Paris for 24hrs
3238,gRszqN6rHE8,"١٤:٥٩ يا لهويييي 😂😂
I'm very proud of u Ammar 💙"
3239,gRszqN6rHE8,"Inspiring,& makes me nostalgic for Paris, where I spent time living&studying music. I'd love to see more of the raw video just to see more of the streets again; being a poor student I spent a lot of time walking all over Paris. I'd like to replicate the routes he took one day. It'll be a while as I'm stuck in Indiana for the time being. Keep on keepin'on, peeps!"
3240,gRszqN6rHE8,"I have fallen deeply and madly in love with you Ammar! You are such a beautiful young man and such an amazing influence of the youngsters of today, including, of course the gorgeous team members that you work with. So much love and success to the Yes Theory team xxx"
3241,gRszqN6rHE8,I AM PART OF THE 60%
3242,sn_BfMJfhYQ,"Thank you to everyone who has ever watched, subscribed, gotten anything from Seek Discomfort or whatever way you have supported us and been a part of this community. You helped us free Ammar from this constant stress and we can now travel the world together. Thank you thank you thank you for changing all of our lives and unlocking a new world of possibilities for us ❤️"
3243,sn_BfMJfhYQ,how did yall all meet. guess i have to binge watch all the videos...can you guys do some Q & A .
3244,sn_BfMJfhYQ,"Ammar's courage and the perseverance of the whole Yes theory team is an examplary and also it's extraordinary
to watch how you guys have made it!"
3245,sn_BfMJfhYQ,To not feel like “other” in a world full of people you’ve always seen as equal.. is truly a moment. I’m so happy for you.
3246,sn_BfMJfhYQ,"And getting to travel visa free, worth it I guess lol"
3247,sn_BfMJfhYQ,Doing all that to avoid military draft at the country you claimed you love.
3248,sn_BfMJfhYQ,"I only learnt about ""weak"" passports a week or 2 ago. I never knew about getting visas for short non working stays, I guess I thought if it was under a certain amount of time you could get a temporary one on entering the country. I have 3 nationalities British, Australian and New Zealand, i live in New Zealand but grew up in England cause im not a native Kiwi I have a lot of none kiwi friends and theyve always said how luckily I was but I thought it was because I could live and work in all 3 countries not that I could get holiday visas easier. I do know how hard it is to be away from family as my family is spread between many countries and I can't travel due to health. I knew about mandatory military service, I don't know how you coped being stuck between countries, I couldn't have managed. All that work you and your friends did is amazing good for you😊"
3249,sn_BfMJfhYQ,thank you for making people with a nice passport realise what they have
3250,sn_BfMJfhYQ,"all you need, is money,first money to buy passport, second you need money to but air ticket , hotel , food , insurance , last is you do not need to go to work, or your job is travel, i have UK passport , but i could not go any where with out money."
3251,sn_BfMJfhYQ,As a Singaporean I never realised how blessed I was to be able to travel so easily. Thank you for opening my eyes and making me so grateful for the opportunities I have. So happy for you and hope you continue to have amazing and fun adventures!
3252,sn_BfMJfhYQ,I quit when the idiot started to mention CO2
3253,sn_BfMJfhYQ,A lot people in the Caricom can’t afford to travel to a lot of places too
3254,sn_BfMJfhYQ,Why he can only enter that country with US visa and it’s not US territory or the US?
3255,sn_BfMJfhYQ,I’m Jamaican by birth and I never realized the power of my passport . It is a caricom passport that he is paying all that money to get and I pay less than $100 USD to get my passport. I’m an American citizen too
3256,sn_BfMJfhYQ,"You know it's a fucked up world when no one members of the KKK and other white supremacy groups can freely travel around the world with zero hiccups, but Middle Eastern people, just because they were born somewhere in the middle east, have to jump through hoops and more and completely humiliate themselves"
3257,sn_BfMJfhYQ,What does having a brother have to do with being forced to sign up for the military??
3258,sn_BfMJfhYQ,11:16 ❤
3259,sn_BfMJfhYQ,"That's exciting news. However, wow does that ever speak of ACCESS. Only if you have the money can you get such a privilege. So you have to be rich to buy another citizenship? It just shows that money is necessary to live a ""happy and free"" life in some cases, like this. A lot of people in the world don't have the privilege to have 150,000USD to open those kinds of doors. It's problematic to show this kind of video, don't you think? I like your videos that celebrate the people and their different lives, and the things that have allowed them to overcome the barriers in front of them, regardless of the money they have. It makes room for perspective."
3260,sn_BfMJfhYQ,Awww Ammar!! Allah akbar! so happy for him! Also make me grateful for my ability to move so freely! ❤
3261,sn_BfMJfhYQ,"St, Christopher is the one who saved you .. not ahamadulla 🤷‍♂️.."

My feeling—AB SO LUTELY"
3273,RXWyuO3v4vM,"We need this meetup again, loved this video and it looked like a lot of fun.
Stoltman Brothers are good people."
3274,RXWyuO3v4vM,tom now 2 time worlds strongest man! and 2nd place in 2023! amazing
3275,RXWyuO3v4vM,Do strong men eat all the meals with no shirts?

3280,RXWyuO3v4vM,"I don’t know why, but as soon as it cut to all 5 of you sitting at the table shirtless, I started DYING laughing 😂"
3281,RXWyuO3v4vM,@thestoltmanbrothers are such gentle souls.
3282,vdkQWgZLrYA,"This is probably one of the most sensitive conflict zones in the world at the moment and I did my best telling a high-level version of the story that still stays fair and discusses the major events. There are endless more elements that would have to be mentioned for the whole conflict to be understood, so I highly recommend you dive deeper into this if you are interested in fully comprehending it. I honestly was ignorant to how sensitive things still were when I arrived and I'm glad I changed that by getting to hear real stories from people in the Yes Fam. It was pretty surreal driving across this de-facto border and hearing the tragic stories on both sides. I just hope that Cyprus and Cypriots will one day find peace and a prosperous future."
3283,vdkQWgZLrYA,how scary so much can go to waste. Great work guys.
3284,vdkQWgZLrYA,"All I have to say the entire world doesn’t recognise the Turkish side. In some situations, there is bad and there is good.  Using the word “complicated” or “complex” doesn’t cut it."
3285,vdkQWgZLrYA,I really loved this video but you left out important details about British Empire meddling and setting up Greek and Turkish against each other. This is the fault of all three governments but I can help but feel that the British gov is mostly to blame .
3286,vdkQWgZLrYA,Divide & Conquer 🇬🇧 😉
3287,vdkQWgZLrYA,Greece is responsible for it after bloody coup
3288,vdkQWgZLrYA,"the ""used bullet"" is actually a blank"
3289,vdkQWgZLrYA,Great vid. Painful for the good people who lost everything and still live in limbo.
3290,vdkQWgZLrYA,I just found you guy's and instantly leave a like and subscribe. Keep doing you awesome 🎉
3291,vdkQWgZLrYA,I had no idea about this. I’m curious as to why they won’t allow anyone to enter the buildings? Why keep it guarded like they do? Just a shame that those in charge aren’t smart enough to see how ridiculous this actually is.
3292,vdkQWgZLrYA,it was not Vietnam war. It was the america invasion!
3293,vdkQWgZLrYA,"Heartbreaking,,,,,"
3294,vdkQWgZLrYA,"Cyprus is a beautiful country. People are very friendly and humble in the south. It’s heartbreaking to see that innocent people, even they were Turkish or Greek Cypriots, suffered in this war. Politics sometimes ruin ordinary people life’s and it is unfair. I am a Lithuanian and we also have a dark history when my ancestors were exiled to Siberia, my grand-grandfathers died from hunger and exhausting work here. I am happy that my grandmother stayed alive so I am here. And these family tragedies are because of the politics. Wish all the best for all the people living in this beautiful Mediterranean island."
3295,vdkQWgZLrYA,"You guys are amazing, opening our eyes to these amazing people"
3296,vdkQWgZLrYA,"It gave me a little bit of goosebumps how similar the architecture/construction of buildings are to Greece. Even a half standing/remaining door of an old building gave me deja vu of a similar one I have seen in my home town.
I guess it made sense seeing that the majority there was greek before the invasion.
Also, the actual name in English is Famagusta, I don't know why you said Varosha."
3297,vdkQWgZLrYA,My heart breaks for the community of this country and I wish peace and love for a United Country of Cyprus❤❤❤
3298,vdkQWgZLrYA,That's a sad sad sorry
3299,vdkQWgZLrYA,"I'm from the UK, now in OZ
I went to cypress on a family holiday in 1994 when I was 13.
We stayed in protaras.
I was always a nerd so dad took the hit and took me to the farmagutsa  watch tower look out and kickstarted my unhealthy interest in abandoned places"
3300,vdkQWgZLrYA,Give it back
3301,vdkQWgZLrYA,What a waste my god like come on lots of people need housing

3304,HXzhcfYlKFQ,"I think this is what communism do to it's civilians(Not talking about politics or anything just the people). When I was child my country (Mongolia was just moving out from communism to democracy. Those buildings and people, everything is just taking me back to my childhood."
3305,HXzhcfYlKFQ,Its those who have least that are the most giving. Truly believe this
3306,HXzhcfYlKFQ,Have you googled this name?? It was one of the largest nazi kingdom of death. One of the worst concentration camps! Not a word haaa?
3307,HXzhcfYlKFQ,"Basically they are the Kurds and Kurdistan of europe, in regards to their nation and personality towards life and guest  ❤️"
3308,HXzhcfYlKFQ,"It`s a fake country like USA 🤣 Because, the US-People raid land, because they came from europe and killed everyone living there native 🤮 So its funny, if US Guys talking about Countys not existing  🤣"
3309,HXzhcfYlKFQ,I cry every time I watch this
3310,HXzhcfYlKFQ,"I love how I see you celebrating football and a ad pops up of a horror movie, I start feeling weird and the vid ends and it comes back to u guys being amazing"
3311,HXzhcfYlKFQ,Hope to visit that place. People there have pure intentions 🥰
3312,HXzhcfYlKFQ,That reminded me of my Russian friend's mother who kinda adopted me when I lived there. Miss her a lot <3
3313,HXzhcfYlKFQ,This was a beautiful and touching episode. thank you
3314,HXzhcfYlKFQ,Thank you for lowering your voices in the church. Your respect for others is what makes you such welcome visitors everywhere ❤

3322,Vn-2L8absR0,"Thank you for all the support this season. Covid really did make it almost impossible for us to run this channel, but bit by bit we are coming back in full strength. HOPE YOU ENJOYED THIS CRAZY EPISODE!"
3323,Vn-2L8absR0,"Love this stuff! Amazing and wish the world had more people like you guys! 

If you want a real serious challenge: Go to Vietnam and get 30 people to do this of the 100 million population. Impossible mission because VN people would NEEVR seek discomfort and would never even understand this concept. They seek the most easy and comfortable way through life, more than any group of people I’ve met in my 40+ countries I’ve visited. Spend 12 hours in Downtown Saigon with roughly 9 million and you’d not get ONE VN. 

Challenge accepted?"
3324,Vn-2L8absR0,This is the most beautiful video I’ve ever seen on the internet. I’m all tears!
3325,Vn-2L8absR0,"Stephan, (I don;t know if I spelled correctly) I used to be a bit of racist. Yes theory changed that in my life. If you are ever in the Netherlands PM me and I will be your tourguide and your host! You are such a great person and I would be honered to meet you! You would come here as a stranger, but we will eat, drink, laugh, learn, party, cry, and say goodbye as friends and brothers for life."
3326,Vn-2L8absR0,7:13 just a topless woman casually 🤣

3331,Vn-2L8absR0,"The night swim scene was my favorite,  all of the different languages and then the next morning. Happy tears here, again."
3332,Vn-2L8absR0,Rewatch8ng all the yes tgeoryvideos and just seeing Thomas grow has been so entertaining. Little by little he becomes so much more confident. Love to see it

3345,q_BCdZUxRI8,Pleaaaaaase come to the baltics. We have a harsh and complicated history and often get labled as antisocial and emotionless... That is not true at all and i would love to see someone showing what the baltic people are really like. (Tallinn has one of the best reserved old towns;))
3346,q_BCdZUxRI8,Wait…wait…socialism and communism didn’t work?  Huh…who knew

3362,sgLvkrMBgdY,Extremely overexadurated
3363,sgLvkrMBgdY,Here we are in 2023 and watching athletes trying this plant diet for years now and getting injured every other game the best diets ALWAYS been a balanced diet
3364,sgLvkrMBgdY,"I ate one McDonalds burger - and that put me off them for life. Now I see those ads with burgers looking slick and shiny with fat and it makes my stomach turn.
On the other hand, I was taught from a very young age to be a sugar addict. No matter how hard I try, I give in to it at some point in the day. Even if it's a teaspoon of jam (today, it was flavoured yoghurt).
It is lucky that I live 8 miles from the nearest town, don't like driving enough to go to the shops myself, and have a husband who's strong enough to say no. If I lived within an hour's walk of a shop, I'd be a diabetic by now."
3365,sgLvkrMBgdY,"lol.... nutella on waffles? basically my late night ""dinner"" every night this week 🤣😅😅😅"
3366,sgLvkrMBgdY,literally my life and pretty much nothing happens due to my quick metabolism. my body just burn the calories hell out and at 17 I'm literally 69 kilos.
3367,sgLvkrMBgdY,så jævli lætts
3368,sgLvkrMBgdY,"I was part of the middle class bracket in America for about 5 - 5 1/2 years of my life. That was the only time that I lived a life where we could afford to eat healthy steadily and ever eat organic. Anytime prior to that time and after that time, I've never made enough whether by myself or combined with the other person I have lived with to afford to eat healthy steadily or a Ford organic ever. In america, at least, those things are for the wealthy and that's that. Nothing more to talk about there. Oh, and we have farmers markets and I live in the agricultural Hub of the entire country, and I pay about five times more just for a tiny little basket of strawberries or I had a broccoli then I do it any grocery store, and I can't afford it, maybe the wealthy 1% can, so great for them"
3369,sgLvkrMBgdY,"I would love to eat healthy but i just cant get myself to eat salads and ravbit food, that's just absolutely no taste whatsoever just like water and i feel empty.lol. I don't eat great food but i only eat once a day and not much at all when i do but just enough to fill me up and keep going and i also don't eat candy and crap like that.Now my downfall is that i do drink alot of sodas which isn't good and i need to change that but it's gonna be hard,oh and i smoke which i absolutely HATE and DESPISE now but it's so hard to stop.."
3370,sgLvkrMBgdY,I appreciated that Key and Peele reference. One of my favorite skits.
3371,sgLvkrMBgdY,"I just ate 4 slices of pizza while watching this, highly recommended"
3372,sgLvkrMBgdY,"wow this video made me disgusted of sugar in such a profound way.. it broke my heart to see Thomas eat all that shit. I have been struggling with healthy eating since the pandemic... this year in particular, after so many years of ""healthy eating"" I kind of knew everything you said, but it woke me up again. THANK YOU GUYS"
3373,sgLvkrMBgdY,"You swear
I’m gone"
3374,sgLvkrMBgdY,"I eat out occasionally but my mom mostly cooks at home, lots if vegetables and fruits. I know that's not what a lot of Americans do and that could be for many different reasons, but it always blows my mind how unhealthy people eat throughout the day."
3375,sgLvkrMBgdY,Side effects: You become gay 5:13
3376,sgLvkrMBgdY,My diet is worse
3377,sgLvkrMBgdY,"I was eating a chicken sandwich a orange soda a fries while watching this… and i was like dangg its been a while since I’ve actually ate properly so thanks yes theory 
💪😎💅"
3378,sgLvkrMBgdY,Really? Didn't weight before and after the 7 days??
3379,sgLvkrMBgdY,As a college student the food at college is hard on my goodness. Im used to eating clean and now in college my stomach isn’t liking the food as much. I definitely see the difference 😂
3380,sgLvkrMBgdY,"That was insane, had better to return with your daily routine, fast food especially I don't prefer but it was necessary for ""the"" experiment

I only hope your friend keep going with cook and have healthy recepies yeah but besides he's an amazing cooker haha"

3383,kISB5sum51Y,Man I need to go to North Dakota! In the summer time of course I’m not crazy. Great use of ChatGPT! You must do this more often! 🎉🎉
3384,kISB5sum51Y,ChatGPT was launched only 1 year ago. How are they talking about ChatGPT in a 2 years old video? Tell me they changed the video name
3385,kISB5sum51Y,The Governor of North Dakota is so cool!!
3386,kISB5sum51Y,"Damn, the governor of North Dakota is awesome."
3387,kISB5sum51Y,#NETFLIX this video is more entertaining than at least 60% of the content on Netflix
3388,kISB5sum51Y,#NAME why did the title change from AI controls our life to Chat GPT is it the negative connotations of AI
3389,kISB5sum51Y,that is bit scary
3390,kISB5sum51Y,"Currently about to get surgery on my ACL, thinking about what you guys stand for, seeking discomfort is the one thing that’s helping me get through it.  So grateful for you guys 🙌🍃🧚🌻"

3393,kISB5sum51Y,"This should be something Yes Theory do once a year, like an annual tradition because AI is and has only gotten better and it was cool and interesting to see what and where it took yall."
3394,kISB5sum51Y,Coming back here in 2023 when Chat GPT is more mainstream
3395,kISB5sum51Y,Who else remembered Doug Burgum from this Yes Theory video and NOT just from the 2024 Republican Debate?
3396,kISB5sum51Y,The AI knew he liked yes theory
3397,kISB5sum51Y,"I wen to college in Fargo for 5 years, and Bismarck is known as an oil town, you shouldn’t go to them unless you live there or are being escorted by a resident of the town"

3403,7FWwjVHMgEU,Absolutely no clue what the Chocolate Rain one was. Never heard of that even a tiny bit till right now!
3404,7FWwjVHMgEU,"Weird seen antoine, as the last time I saw him he had super super long weaved hair, and was as gay as it gets!"
3405,7FWwjVHMgEU,"What about ""Triple Rainbow"" guy?"
3406,7FWwjVHMgEU,I'm from Egypt and even here chocolate rain was popular along with Nyan Nyan Cat thingy and the maya haha guy 😂 fun times when youtube algorithm was actually nice and makes you venture into unexpected stuff rather than show you what you already know.... Miss those days of freedom
3407,7FWwjVHMgEU,"Pitty that you always cut the ""best"" part of the quote."

3411,7FWwjVHMgEU,David grew up to be a douche lol
3412,7FWwjVHMgEU,9 children and no father. Is that the men’s fault or the woman’s fault?
3413,7FWwjVHMgEU,"Antoine's actual story was dark, saving sister from rape.... glad that he and his family has overcome that.... David was definitely roasted, but I think it was a honest mistake from YES THEORY team, should have avoided doing stuff spontaneously stuff like visiting a Dentist, when you are spontaneous you make mistakes, when you plan ahead you get better and fun ideas."
3414,7FWwjVHMgEU,"I actually lived in lincoln park (Antoine's neighborhood) from around 2013 up until last year. I moved to somewhere better off, but seeing this video makes me miss it.

P.S. that neighbor he was talking about that still lives there, pretty sure i know which one. not certain tho"

3417,7FWwjVHMgEU,"💀💀i thought the dentist would eventually say “im just joking David, your teeth are fine” 🤣"
3418,7FWwjVHMgEU,I don't think I can understand.
3419,7FWwjVHMgEU,"5 seconds after David after dentist walked away, he unsubscribed to Yes Theory."
3420,7FWwjVHMgEU,16:47 nice spit.
3421,7FWwjVHMgEU,"Wow, you wouldn't think that a stupid few seconds long meme video, that even though it went viral, can have such a big impact on people's life. What a great and unique kind of video, you guys bring up so many new and different perspectives for so many people around the globe with your videos, thanks a lot for your awesome work! ❤

That being said, please don't just hug a person that you know is autistic, always ask for their permission before, because for most autistic people being this close and actually touching a rather foreign person in such an intimate way is incredibly awkward and unpleasant. I can't speak for every autistic person but at least it's like this for me and pretty much every other autistic people I got to know a bit better ;D"
3422,TQcODHmw378,"I'm grinning all over again, thank you so much for sticking with it long enough that you were in that elevator!
To go from not knowing who you were to being one of your biggest fans... As much as I loved EVERY minute of the trip, I think my absolute favorite part was watching how genuinely kind you were to everyone who recognized you. You embody your message ""You are not alone"" and the world needs this now more than ever.
Friends for life, deal? Logan (the newly Russian Chihuahua 🤣) says we have to take him along next!"
3423,TQcODHmw378,In my apartment they put a music in the lift which makes it more awkward😂

3442,ersITE-HiLI,"As you can see, we decided to not add any sponsors or plugs on this story so we could focus on the story-telling and visual experience. But making a video of this complexity without sponsor is definitely not easy, the support from Seek Discomfort is largely how we're able to create stories like this one. It took us several months get the edit to this place and a few days of filming. I'm super proud of how the video came out and hope you enjoy it. Watch it on a TV for full experience :) See you next week - Thomas"

We take care of each other in the time of Crisis as long as we can see the crisis in front of us and it's tangible, so to speak. And then as soon as the crisis is a seemingly over even if it really isn't, such as the pandemic, everyone forgets about everyone else and it's basically fuck you to the world until the next catastrophic event happens and then we only help those directly around us and not just the planet, as a whole"

3462,8pl8Rai0OWM,"Hi all, Thomas here. This is a bit of a different video I’ve been wanting to make for a very long time. It doesn’t fit the typical Yes Theory adventure format and I wasn’t sure if people would care so for a long time I decided against it. I wrote this story 5 different ways and eventually decided that sharing my journey with mental health and how meditation has served me as an amazing companion through this, could help many that struggled the same way I have. This year in particular has been filled with unexpected challenges but we are feeling more and more like ourselves again. We are growing, learning and finding a new flow within our process that you will see the results of very soon. Excited to share and excited for more stories 💫 cheers to you all fellow Peace of Mind Seekers ✌️"
3463,8pl8Rai0OWM,"Also in the American School system, dyslexia is barely recognized and like myself in the 90s, my teacher told my mom in various ways, when I want to learn I will. Not a single teacher in my entire School career ever recognize / acknowledged I had dyslexia and that that was the cause of all of my issues in school not a guidance counselor, not a teacher, not a principal, not a counselor, no one!"
3464,8pl8Rai0OWM,it's crazy how this is part of my culture as a hindu but I am learning about it through a western lens in this video
3465,8pl8Rai0OWM,"I am a beginner in meditation, thanks for this ❤️."

3470,8pl8Rai0OWM,"13:36 I know that we're talking about the pandemic but the line ""every idea, every hope that I had for the future...taken away"" still sounded a little dramatic. You could still do stuff, just in a limited way."

3472,8pl8Rai0OWM,Thanks

3474,8pl8Rai0OWM,it's an ad
3475,8pl8Rai0OWM,"Thank you so much for the video man, I'm not even subscribed to your channel but I absolutely loved this story and for sure have been needing this for a little (maybe long) while now ❤ you've inspired me to start a 100 day meditation challenge as well and I will be looking to start a Headspace subscription as well, this is such an amazing and important tool to have in our lives ❤ will check out your videos as well, you guys seem amazing! Thank you so much for this man, me and many others needed to hear a story like this to feel more hopeful and motivated to take the right steps in our personal journey ❤ Big love dude!"
3476,8pl8Rai0OWM,I don't have the best experiences with meditation. It was part of a school I went to to meditate in a specific way for 30 minutes every day and it just didn't work for me. So I avoided meditation. But seeing how it effected you I might give it a shot. My mind is always racing and crippling me to a degree I turned into a shut-in. And I want to get out of that.
3477,8pl8Rai0OWM,The interview with Bhutan was insightful to me.
3478,8pl8Rai0OWM,"I know this is a pretty old video, but I recently found your channel and it's really changed the way I live and experience life. I appreciate the content you guys upload and thank you for inspiring people around the world :)"

3480,8pl8Rai0OWM,"Thomas, just wow. I've put off watching this video, because I was scared of maybe altering my current course of doing things the way I do them, but this is so freakin inspiring. Thanks so much. Struggling with anxiety this will surely be a journey I will undertake"
3481,8pl8Rai0OWM,Thank you for sharing your personal journey!  It resonates and inspires me to continue my meditation journey.

3485,Uu-u8LEC1ek,"watching some old ones I never checked out.  Really interesting to see the growth of the guys.  This video felt a bit like just an ego challenge for clicks whereas I feel like now they'd look into the empathetic story of miners that live in that darkness, had to leave their families and mine for raw materials for all the consumption that drives the modern world.  Would love to see these guys relook back as some videos and missed opportunities and what they learned."

3492,Uu-u8LEC1ek,Listen up. During February of 1985 around valentines day we had our annual precipitation in three days.. it was a massive flood in the south fork of the American river.. just 25 miles from pollock Pines gold was discovered in jan. 1848 and thus the 49’scame to California..  The river was a mess and culverts all over the Eldorado NF were plugged and teams of employees left their normal job to open culverts and prevent roads from being washed out..  Later on in mid summer folks were looking for gold above pollock pines.. a friend found a 120 ounce nugget in the south fork..  kept hush hush..  but more are there I am sure..
3493,Uu-u8LEC1ek,"This is nice and cute. Come to Switzerland and spend a few nights in the cave with us. You also get to explore. What to do in a mine/cave??? Explore. I never get bored, only in pain or hungry from exploring :)) There is SO MUCH to see in the Underworld! Come to Switzerland and join us in a true caving experience :)"

To celebrate, we created a collection called “Moonshot” on Seek Discomfort for the dreams so big they scare you just thinking about them... See the collection here: https://www.seekdiscomfort.com"
3543,Mvher-mKt1Y,I laughed and cried. I felt every second of this video. Amazing!

3548,Mvher-mKt1Y,I love how the guy recording the jump had to prepare for the same jump haha
3549,Mvher-mKt1Y,Boohoo u were in a car accident aeast u can walk. I got in a accident n  I can't walk n will never skydive like I used to. Stop crying about ur car accident where u never got hurt. Be greatful
3550,Mvher-mKt1Y,Absolutely incredible.!!!!!
3551,Mvher-mKt1Y,That would be so cool to achieve too but im big wuss at tall buildings so no ty sky
3552,Mvher-mKt1Y,This just inspired me to quit my job in 2024 . I’m ready to let go . Iv thought about it for years but was never brave enough to seek the discomfort that would come with it. I’m ready …thank you Yes Theory….
3553,Mvher-mKt1Y,My dream is to keep my feet on the ground
3554,Mvher-mKt1Y,Ammar I’m sorry but he is the biggest show off on yes theory he definitely needs to understand all the vids he does that are about him suck and make no views
3555,Mvher-mKt1Y,habibi
3556,Mvher-mKt1Y,"such an inspiring story including your other videos on skydiving, it perfectly encapsulates the way I felt before, during, and after doing my first jump. And now I am hooked. Thank you so much for sharing this with all of us."
3557,Mvher-mKt1Y,Watching Ammar’s journey on this episode was so emotional for me. I was crying tears of joy and excitement for him. He is such a beautiful human! So proud of him ❤🎉
3558,Mvher-mKt1Y,"Being paralyzed from the navel down, scuba diving seems like great relief. Silfra Iceland, where the tectonic plates of America and Eur-Asia meet, definitely seems worth the trip."

3562,3NYgET0lCA4,I don’t understand how no one has purchased this and finished it. It makes no sense for a bank to sit on property like this. Absolutely bonkers to me. The developer shouldn’t have done so much at once. That was the downfall. No developer does that.

3574,3NYgET0lCA4,Great video!
3575,3NYgET0lCA4,I always wonder what feelings or emotions people feel when they go into these kinds of abandoned places.. like what kind of energy is left behind. I know this wasnt a spooky place or something haunted but im sure you can sense some sort of energy walking around in places like this.
3576,3NYgET0lCA4,They should paint each one a different bright color. Or have graffiti artists work on them.
3577,3NYgET0lCA4,"it was meant to be a holiday village for rich arabs who don't get to experience greenery and snow in their own countries. there is a massive legal fight going on between the developers, investors and the banks"

It's crazy you guys also were helped by Sidamar, amazing guy! Your depiction of what the train ride is like is really accurate, the struggle, the discomfort, the lack of sleep, the dust, but then still the adrenaline, the hype, the happy and exciting feelings throughout all of that.🔥🤙
Mauritania man… I can highly recommend!🇲🇷❤️"
3592,wAeZ-HSFdTw,anyone know how they flew drone over the train
3593,wAeZ-HSFdTw,lmfao the driver cant even see all these people just casually hopping on the train
3594,wAeZ-HSFdTw,"When dude said someone is praying in his dream, isn't it sign for him"
3595,wAeZ-HSFdTw,that background sound gives me emotion
3596,wAeZ-HSFdTw,"The music at 19:45 is simply amazing 
Could you please help me what the music is

#yestheory you guys are creating impact"
3597,wAeZ-HSFdTw,"Considering the plethora of health hazards breathing in iron ore, it just doesn't seem worth it"
3598,wAeZ-HSFdTw,How is that train deadly though🤔 how many people die on it every year 🤔😂
3599,wAeZ-HSFdTw,"This country and Somalia have a lot in common, it can be said that Mauritania is Somalia, and Somalia is Mauritania in terms of color, culture, lifestyle, and religion. I already watched Peter vlogs from Mauritania, the Slovenian YouTuber who took  Iron Ore train trip. It's  amazing and a real-life experience. I enjoyed your trip, guys."
3600,wAeZ-HSFdTw,This is one of the whitest things I've ever seen.
3601,wAeZ-HSFdTw,That was something.
3602,P9vwbbTgkzc,OMG I opened this at middle of night 🥶
3603,P9vwbbTgkzc,Don’t ever accept a sponsor from skillshare……. They have already been outed as a scam who rip off people. I’m actually really shocked you would do this for money especially from them…… you need to do some research yes theory.

3609,P9vwbbTgkzc,"kings park is underrated its in new york long island yall should try that its way scarier, Kings park insane aslyum and i did a overnight and we explored the underground tunnels which go on for miles and have homeless people walk throuhh them. When one of my boys were sleeping and we were just chillling we hear stomping around the big ass building and then a creepy homeless kinda looking guy with no flashlight in the pitch dark claimed he hes a cop and he told us to leave  yelling super loud and walked us to the stairs and didnt walk down with us but kept screaming for us to leave till we got out the building and even when we kike 700 feet away from the building we heard the echo of his scream"
3610,P9vwbbTgkzc,There are forces you should not dapple in ..BEWARE!
3611,P9vwbbTgkzc,"When these paranormal investigators in YouTube it's like they get demons and ghost and those devices go off left and right - everyday travel and challenge vliggers do it, nothing happens. Hmmmmmm mmmmmmhmmmmm"

3618,P9vwbbTgkzc,"I can't believe of every great thing I've seen you very intelligent people do, you submit to this disgusting shit. Making money from mental illness, torture and misery. Are you fucking kidding?🤬"
3619,P9vwbbTgkzc,That doll at 8:54 looked like he was chillin out hard af
3620,P9vwbbTgkzc,"Didn't see any albino nuns running around, disappointed."

The stories and love across the world are so inspiring and a true eye opener to believe there is still HOPE ❗️🌍♥️🩷🤗"
3624,TWRlPKMAkRk,I love this video! I recently went to Kurdistan and this does a such a great job at showing the beautiful people and land!
3625,TWRlPKMAkRk,💌
3626,TWRlPKMAkRk,Hugg a friend near you :)
3627,TWRlPKMAkRk,Listening to baderkhan talk makes me feel sad but so good about humanity he has such a good perspective on life. Baderkhan for president lol
3628,TWRlPKMAkRk,I’ve only watched 2 videos of yours so far. Turkmenistan and this. Both were extremely good. However you might have unintentionally showed the Arab part of Iraq as a zone that shouldn’t be entered by tourists.it’s as safe as the Kurdish part of Iraq and ppl are as welcoming. You should go to Baghdad and southern Iraq to experience that for yourself.
3629,TWRlPKMAkRk,oh so cool to hear from the perspective of a woman! Thank you for sharing those snippets too!
3630,TWRlPKMAkRk,Baderkhan❤...so full of life
3631,TWRlPKMAkRk,"What a beautiful country, and Baderkhan is such a gold star level of human being, what an adventure he lives. These videos are so inspiring. I'll probably never visit Iraq but seeing it makes me hopeful."
3632,TWRlPKMAkRk,Abraham was from Ur. In Mesopotamia/Iraq.
3633,TWRlPKMAkRk,That place is nearly as old as the Nicene Creed that established the verity/ sanctity of the Trinity and the Convention when they finalized the books that were included in the Bible for context...
3634,TWRlPKMAkRk,I'm the same way. Everything reminds me if a song. And I love to laugh.
3635,TWRlPKMAkRk,This is how we are ❤
3636,TWRlPKMAkRk,"So, basically your entire trip was in Kurdistan and you kept calling it “Iraq”, thanks for the insult towards us that we were forced to be Iraqis and you just added to that national oppression. Kudos to you!"
3637,TWRlPKMAkRk,ill join any religion i want actually my dude
3638,TWRlPKMAkRk,As a  kurdish  live in Kurdistan this video makes me cry I'm crying about our tragedy history 😢free kurdsitan ❤❤
3639,TWRlPKMAkRk,It is very surprising that you have reached Iraq and not visited the Holy city of Karbala..
3640,TWRlPKMAkRk,"I like Iraq from Iran, great history ,great identity ,beautiful geography and lovely people! 🇮🇷🇮🇶"
3641,TWRlPKMAkRk,I have been watching your amazing travels and living through your experiences I have always dreamed of visiting many different countries and experience different culture I wanted to say thank you for your videos.

3645,TRjISzJPsuk,I’m watching this again two years after I first watched it and I’m going through a big change in my life after finding out I’m being made redundant from my work. I have no idea what is to come but I’m choosing love over fear and going to seek some discomfort.
3646,TRjISzJPsuk,"We love you Matt ! Thanks for your great and fun energy, and good luck in your new path...."
3647,TRjISzJPsuk,"Good choice to leave if it feels right for you. It's social media and a great opportunity to earn money, but if it doesn't fulfill you it's great that you do something else, Matt."
3648,TRjISzJPsuk,Ammar is a truly amazing Friend love and support 🎉 they are real Friends all of Them they respekt and support your choice ❤
3649,TRjISzJPsuk,"Seeing this late, thanks for everything you did and good luck with the new things"

3652,TRjISzJPsuk,"Lately ive been binging thede videos.   I started off with reg, the most awesome cab driver. Also seeing matt in paris. A few videos further i saw matts blind date with a beautifull parisian. I was so hoping she was the reason he left yes theory"

3654,TRjISzJPsuk,This was the moment when i have stopped watching yes theory
3655,TRjISzJPsuk,Yes theory has been apart of my life since 2018 this still breaks me

3682,rCYXM1Z0QVo,I’m in tears
3683,rCYXM1Z0QVo,I can feel you Thom😂 hahahaha….
3684,rCYXM1Z0QVo,Never in life could I do this. Hats off. Dangerous
3685,rCYXM1Z0QVo,The answer is blowing in the wind - lyrics from a famous song
3686,rCYXM1Z0QVo,I love going back and watching this video again.
3687,rCYXM1Z0QVo,"Everyone blames the internet, the phone or whatever. No, it isn't the devices or the tech. The problem is most of the time yourself. Blaming something else is just the easy way."
3688,rCYXM1Z0QVo,"This is all great, amazing and good for humans and this man Wim Hof is doing great stuff for humanity, but how about give credit to where all of these techniques originated from? Not one mention of any of these techniques mentioned, done and showcased long before from Shaolin Monks. Even the ""Om"" meditation @7:20 is directly from ""OM"" mantras. It's just wild to me that no credit whatsoever is given to where these all originated from. The Chinese have been doing these for thousands of years. Still, a great documentary as well as the first one. Wim Hof is a very likeable man and fun to watch."
3689,rCYXM1Z0QVo,Wim Hof is like the cool uncle times million
3690,rCYXM1Z0QVo,The most incredible thing I find is that he still has all his toes and fingers! HOW?! How come other people get frost bite and all that stuff. Its really super Human!
3691,rCYXM1Z0QVo,This guy is the monster under David Goggins Bed!
3692,rCYXM1Z0QVo,I quit my job and started ice bath everyday for a week. Now got a new job to have fund to buy more ice to do more ice bath.
3693,rCYXM1Z0QVo,"Je veux revoir cet homme 
Merci pour ton contenu de qualité toi et ton équipe font un travail formidable 
Je te souhaite le meilleur pour la suite 🫶"
3694,rCYXM1Z0QVo,amaaaaazing!!!
3695,rCYXM1Z0QVo,I don' think so
3696,rCYXM1Z0QVo,"Cold exposure allows us to make UV light inside us that's stronger than the sun provides, In UVC range.  It helps to activate and optimise the leptin melanocortin pathway..."
3697,rCYXM1Z0QVo,Thomas and Wim Hof is the best combo. Like Yin and Yang 😀
3698,rCYXM1Z0QVo,chill tf out wim hoff showed you this shit gave you that inner peace stop staringg you down
3699,rCYXM1Z0QVo,"Amazing stuff, but… Yeah … the breathing stuff looked a lot like demon possession, I’d be careful what i subject myself to"
3700,rCYXM1Z0QVo,"This guy is such a great person i bet he is a Amazing Dad and probably smokes some pot every now and then ,he reminds me alot of people i grew up with and look up to as role models i hope i can soon build my crazy dream house i defenitly will take some inspiration from his home ..."
3701,rCYXM1Z0QVo,imagine if he had neighbours and all they hear every morning is yelling and screaming and water splashing at 7 lol
3702,lPIeD2MFs8k,Once you see it you can't unsee it. When I was in my 20s I saw what many are calling a tick-tac UFO/UAP today darting from one part of the sky to another. I was one of about 20-30 people who seen this at a drive in movie (dusk still light out before the movie started). Was in the papers the following day.
3703,lPIeD2MFs8k,I saw something. I just tell myself it was a drone. I don’t even think about it anymore. Idk how I’d feel if I actually knew what it was. It was literally right on top of me. Maybe 30’ above me. The sound it made was like a huge electrical panel. More of a buzzing than a fan noise like a drone. Who knows. It’s hard for me to even believe this stuff.
3704,lPIeD2MFs8k,"SO MUCH TRUTH! thank you, Yes Theory!"
3705,lPIeD2MFs8k,"Maybe I am just to cynical, but come on you all - they (the village) even have a theme park about ufo.
It is not really that hard to figure out that they, the villager, more or less had to do something to attract paying visitors to their village. And what could be better than a ufo theme park.
Welll, maybe a ghost theme park perhaps.

Thats why the local police chief refused to meet with the guys. Because he was ashamed, or felt that he just couldn't lie, it was enough to just play along, since it all was for a good cause (the survival of the village).

Commersialized ghost stories have been a staple in the adventure tourism since at least hundred years ago, so it is just a natural development to include ufo stories to that. After all it is the hype right now, so why not at least try it."
3706,lPIeD2MFs8k,I live in the berkshires. I lived in pittsfield all my life in the city but i moved out to North adams 6 years ago kinda on the side of a mountain a little and outside my place i can see nothing but sky and in the summer time at night i always catch something i cant explain. Nothing has been super close but ive watched balls of light shine in the sky and move from one part of the sky to the other in a flash. Its crazy but i see it 25 percent of the time i sit and look up in the sky
3707,lPIeD2MFs8k,"14:29 If she blew up computers, she'd do the same to cameras. Modern cameras are just computers. This is just someone who wants attention."
3708,lPIeD2MFs8k,"my 2 buddies and my buddy's mom and sister saw 7 orbs (if you've ever played Destiny you know what an orb of light look like after you get kills w ur super and generate orbs of light , this is exactly what they looked like but orange) and they would appear and disappear in North Ridgeville Ohio in like 2017ish if i had to guess.... and over a couple minute period or so...after the first 2 he ran and yelled for his mom..her and his older sister came out and you can see the orange orn glowing across the sky and you can hear us freaking out cuz they are appearing outta NO WHERE !!! and disappearing into NO WHERE ! nothing crazy like this dudes fake story, but we saw orbs. and id say about when the 5th or 6th orb appeared...there was 2 orbs side by side and only this one time was there 2 orbs that appeared the rest of the times it was a single orb, theyd appear the ntravel slowly like 20mph across the sky for 15 seconds then disappear and this is only like maybe 200 yards away from us over the woods down the road . but its not dense woods. like middle of the city woods where you can pretty much see the other side of the woods as soon as you walk in...we have a snapchat of iy, 2 of the,. but it was when you could only take a 10 sec snap..it didnt keep recording, this was years before that update...so snap would just recording after 10 seconds...the videos dont show them do anything but move across the saky..idk why my buddy used snapchat..idk why i didnt record. never even crossed my mind i was just mind blown by the experience. the wear appearing OUT OF NO WHERE....out of fkn no where. satraight outta mid air and then just after 15 seconds of moving slowly across the sky at teh snap of a finger boom, gone. they didn't take off or fly away, they were just gone."
3709,lPIeD2MFs8k,"This is better than 90% or more of what you find on netflex....and if it's ufo/alien related, then probably better than 99% of what's out there."
3710,lPIeD2MFs8k,0:53 obama indirectly gave us the answer
3711,lPIeD2MFs8k,"🔦📡Wow, truly a great episode, as always!  This time, however, on a pretty heavy and important stuff!
I remember as Roger Morneau stated in his book Trip into the Supernatural, ""“It’s going to be done in an unique manner, this grand plan, people are going to eat this stuff! Demon spirits will declare themselves to be inhabitants of far distant planets of the galaxies; that are coming to warn the inhabitants of planet earth of the impending destruction of the planet, unless something seriously proper is done to avoid it.” 
If you wanna know more about this topic, you must definitely watch the interview with Roger or another great video called Aliens & UFOs in Bible Prophecy | Disclosed: Deceiving the World | Little Light Studios Documentary. Both can be found on YT. ♾"
3712,lPIeD2MFs8k,Yes I see one 2 on God’s
3713,lPIeD2MFs8k,Woman in the fur coat is not believable at all.
3714,lPIeD2MFs8k,Watching this after our government finally admitted aliens exist is a different feeling. I hope all of these people feel vindicated now.
3715,lPIeD2MFs8k,This woman is a hero. I could tell the minute I looked at her eyes… I appreciate the way everyone involved treated her with respect.
3716,lPIeD2MFs8k,"I would have enjoyed this so much more without the Foul language, especially Cursing God of the Universe.  To me that language makes people sound unintelligent and immature.  I almost chose not to finish the video but I did and it was good. Check back in a month and see if still cursing with foul language, hope not"
3717,lPIeD2MFs8k,drugs are bad.
3718,lPIeD2MFs8k,"FYI Thom Reed was later analyzed by 4 profilers / behaviour analysts, called ""the behaviour panel"", all agreed he tells the truth. In a follow-up interview with that panel, he even told additional detail, including that ""his"" aliens looked like a mantis, not like the typical grey aliens. This is special, but fits other stories from around the planet. Looks like there are multiple species."
3719,lPIeD2MFs8k,People should check out Divid ike interviewing credo mutwa
3720,lPIeD2MFs8k,Eric looks like a young Tim Curry!
3721,lPIeD2MFs8k,"This was so amazing ❤❤  thank you to all the participants. 
This makes me want to watch my favorite alien movie, arrival"

3739,MoP_jkry66k,"Oh perfect, you donated money to a fascist racist terrorist org. Two minutes of honest research reveal BLM for what they are,,,,,an enemy of freedom and unity."
3740,MoP_jkry66k,"If the best of humanity is evacuating to Mars, you guys gotta go."
3741,MoP_jkry66k,Matt…please come back! This video displays your love
3742,J74B2jzr8iA,"Hey everyone, this is obviously a sensitive video for a few different reasons but I hope that you watch it with an open mind and enjoy an unusual story that I think is rarely told. Either way, I’m happy you’re here 🙏"
3743,J74B2jzr8iA,"Thomas you like just like a local in that attire, a true blue pashtun :D"
3744,J74B2jzr8iA,Hi how are you ? can you comming back to Afghanistan.
3745,J74B2jzr8iA,I hate reporters they say fake news to bring up there name to make money
3746,J74B2jzr8iA,Just bumped into this video which made me crying. Such an amazing tour and we had started to know this country better.You’re a hero!
3747,J74B2jzr8iA,I hope he's safe now. Surely he had to flee the country 😢
3748,J74B2jzr8iA,Watching in 2023 and worried about all of the faces we've seen in this video and our withdrawal and the manner of our withdrawal...we need to center narratives around civilians in conflict zones.
3749,J74B2jzr8iA,Deep impact. Thank you so much for this!
3750,J74B2jzr8iA,2023 taliban run afgan heroin production has increased
3751,J74B2jzr8iA,This was a hard watch…. I wonder what has happened to the people here since….
3752,J74B2jzr8iA,"It’s so sad the amount of stigma
We have about different countries just because their governments are corrupt or conflict. People are just people regardless of religion or ethnicity or sexuality."
3753,J74B2jzr8iA,Didn't Herat fall back into the Taliban's hands after the US left? Hope all is well for Noor and the people there🙏😭
3754,J74B2jzr8iA,American TV shows get you thinking people in Afghanistan are Arabic when they look more Turkish then Arabic. They don’t even speak Arabic.
3755,J74B2jzr8iA,he bought you the outfits of the dancing boys
3756,J74B2jzr8iA,We need an update video where you go back and visit the school!
3757,J74B2jzr8iA,I really love yor videos
3758,J74B2jzr8iA,Wow thanks for showingvus that you really cant judge a biok by it cover. Afghan people are just so loving and very giving.
3759,J74B2jzr8iA,This is truly precious. The courage and the love shown here is more than inspiring. Thanks to all the wonderful people of Yes Theory to create such incredibly powerful and inspiring content. I am once again amazed!
3760,J74B2jzr8iA,You don't get anywhere in life worrying about what might offend people. You should never have to put a disclaimer about that. Screw people who are offended when it comes to something that is based off someone's culture and traditions
3761,J74B2jzr8iA,"I've been eating various types of Middle Eastern food since I was a toddler, I would absolutely love to visit there as long as there were no terrorist influences dominating. Too risky otherwise. I have a family, so it wouldn't be an option to do something like this unless I was just on my own with no one back home to care for. Been drinking pomegranate juice for at least the past 25 it's not 30 years of my life"
3762,IFXm5E27dlM,"Hey there, thank you for watching :) I've really missed making videos consistently so I'm very happy to be back. I'm sure this year has had so many ups and downs for all of you as well so I hope to share some positivity through these stories I've captured. This is the first one out of my trip and I've got plenty more coming your way. Let me know what you think in the comments and I'll see you again soon"
3763,IFXm5E27dlM,I LOVE that developer dude! I could listen to him talk all day!
3764,IFXm5E27dlM,Bunch of grifters
3765,IFXm5E27dlM,"as an arab fuck the emirati government and fuck the saudi government and shame on yes theory for always trying to preach against wrongdoings in the world like during BLM and being against slavery in the usa then condone a fake muslim nation like this and spread propaganda over these terrible, environmental disasters that have completely flopped just because you got paid off by some rich political oil emirati who probably has stocks in bin laden's family construction company that built 85% of the ugly ass buildings in dubai that is owned by the saudi prince and hires, underpays, and jails foreign workers by abusing them as using them as literal slaves, then taking their visas and passports so they cant leave, and in the meantime probably have 10 dubai porta potties (search up what that is but be warned).

 im a fan kinda but shame on you yes theory for being like every other influencer and being extremely hypocritical"
3766,IFXm5E27dlM,"You should interview the low wage workers to see how awesome it is!
Unless you're paid by the UAE of course !!! SHILLS"
3767,IFXm5E27dlM,One would think that the people who literally live in a desert would know how volatile sand is can't stay in the sea forever
3768,IFXm5E27dlM,You are a sellout shill for a country who uses slaves
3769,IFXm5E27dlM,Why anyone supports this baffles me
3770,IFXm5E27dlM,"The pure irony and lack of self awareness of Yes Theory amazes me. Claiming to support BLM, and then promoting the UAE which engages in slavery, of Nepalese and other immigrant groups and corruption on a daily basis. SHAME ON YOU"
3771,IFXm5E27dlM,You're so concerned with environmental impact that you're producing useless plastic bracelets to ship out lmao
3772,IFXm5E27dlM,Maybe don’t promote a place built by slave labor.
3773,IFXm5E27dlM,"2:59 WoW they even sell recycle product to protect the environment while inviting by the one who destroy the environment, I guess that equals it out. 😂"
3774,IFXm5E27dlM,Yikes.
3775,IFXm5E27dlM,Er maybe cause it’s just wrong and destroys ecosystems?
3776,IFXm5E27dlM,Dubai Propaganda
3777,IFXm5E27dlM,"my god how backwards and liberal are these guys? ""positivity, love everyone, save the world, dont use oil."" but yet they support islam every other video. the people who drill the most oil in the world. and the people that literally kill you if youre gay. dont believe me? well i got tons of footage for you. ( some recorded by myself when i was overseas. id never go to a middle eastern country again they love killing) also they want to kill everyone who isnt islam. if they cant convert you theyll kill you. and if you still dont believe, then go to the book store. buy a quran. and read it. its totally a peaceful religion 👍"
3778,IFXm5E27dlM,"Wow, you been used on this one"
3779,IFXm5E27dlM,modern day slavery All Lives Matter
3780,IFXm5E27dlM,If it’s literally just sand—not any solid volcanic rock—then how is that foundation not going to crack and the Island disappear in x years?
3781,IFXm5E27dlM,One would think someone so concerned with the environment would know the impact a project like this has on it
3782,dOgXCVhcfOI,I would pay good money to see the uncensored version. 😳
3783,dOgXCVhcfOI,"worst video of YES THEORY, unfortunately.."
3784,dOgXCVhcfOI,Next time uncensored pleased

3789,dOgXCVhcfOI,Nah but like why didnt they start a fire
3790,dOgXCVhcfOI,Somebody's job was just to stare at there penises and make sure there's none showing
3791,dOgXCVhcfOI,Can I see the uncensored version please?
3792,dOgXCVhcfOI,That's  Embarrassing
3793,dOgXCVhcfOI,Why are you tempting me with naked bodies of men??
3794,dOgXCVhcfOI,Love Yes Theory! But you got to be demon possessed to be a gay. These guys look really nice naked.
3795,dOgXCVhcfOI,Yes theory is just a bunch of chill loving bros 😂❤
3796,dOgXCVhcfOI,10 deg/c for sure those boys would've been using each others body heat otherwise hypothermia would've killed them
3797,dOgXCVhcfOI,Cam is a handsome Australian man! Hubba Hubba!
3798,dOgXCVhcfOI,Can u remove the black box please
3799,dOgXCVhcfOI,Thank you for making Cam part of this 😍 If Ammar was there  too I’d be wanting to purchase the unedited version 🤣
3800,dOgXCVhcfOI,Wearing boots is not naked
3801,dOgXCVhcfOI,sorry guys but I dont belive you on this. this seems to be fake. its just to cold and you would try to make fire in this szenario
3802,2WBDSlGdr4E,"Hey everyone, I know we’ve had quite a few start and stops this year and I promise we’re the first to be bummed about it. It’s been a wild year of growth and learning lessons for us. Matt, Ammar, Tommy and I have never closer however. We’ve spent a lot of time working on our relationship and planning what direction we want to go in the future. We all feel super excited and reenergized about this new chapter and we’re happy you’re along with us. We’ll be back with a fresh start in November and are excited to see where the future will take us ❤️

Have an amazing day everyone ✌️"
3803,2WBDSlGdr4E,I don’t understand this video at all
3804,2WBDSlGdr4E,NO      PLACE      LIKE      HOME
3805,2WBDSlGdr4E,No Closed Captions made me sad!😪
3806,2WBDSlGdr4E,i know the feeling i've been living in China for 6 years teaching English....  locked down a lot and away from friends and family...  i watch all your video's have you ever watched mine?  Jimmy the Expat
3807,2WBDSlGdr4E,You look younger. You look great. Beard suits you. Nice hair too.
3808,2WBDSlGdr4E,I like the videos filmed in Europe better. But it's kinda weird that most of you guys are foreigners and you sound like Americans.  I would have never thought you and Ammar were Swedish and Egyptian.
3809,2WBDSlGdr4E,"You made this in october, until the end of the year was 2 months"
3810,2WBDSlGdr4E,What about your girlfriend?
3811,2WBDSlGdr4E,"PLEASE WATCH THE MOVIE ""WAG THE DOG""  A LITTLE MILITARY FYI SO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU HAVE BEEN LIVING IN FOR QUIT SOME TIME NOW!"
3812,2WBDSlGdr4E,"JUST HOLD ON, OUR WORLD IS ABOUT TO CHANGE! BUCKLE UP! YOU ARE IN FOR A HUGE SURPRISE!!!!! XOXO"
3813,2WBDSlGdr4E,"I completely understand this. I felt the exact same, moved back home to Australia from Utah where my family is, right before the border lockdown in 2019. It has been a complete trip trying to deal with the separation from family. Hopefully, I can come back to
The US for Christmas and just hug my fam. Each of us on our personal adventures never knows what is around the corner, we can just prepare ourselves as best we can."
3814,2WBDSlGdr4E,69
3815,2WBDSlGdr4E,Bonjour Thomas-- can you share your personal Youtube channel?-- Merci from Cebu😊
3816,2WBDSlGdr4E,Nowhere is perfect
3817,2WBDSlGdr4E,"proud of you thomas to have considered what you really need! 
im a teen and have had my years of feeling disconnected with my parents but im 20 now and things are different. i do understand them a lot more but im not there just yet. it's like knowing that something different is just around the corner but you aren't there yet.
i've been wanting to stay away from home for a while but not very sure of it now. things are blurry. in the long run tho, definitely. never want to stay away from them. leave for work bidding them a bye and want to get back home with them waiting for me♥️"
3818,2WBDSlGdr4E,"The biggest discomfort I've experienced is committing to those who truly need me. Having suffered tremendous loss in 2019, then experiencing this Pandemic immediately afterward -  I realize what really makes you uncomfortable goes way beyond saying ""YES"" to adventure. What your videos have shown me, is that we must be willing to take risk even when we're accountable for others. Those who need us also need us to be well; physically, emotionally and spiritualy. Please never stop pushing the limit under any amount of responsibility.."
3819,2WBDSlGdr4E,I lost both y parents and I am 26 years old. I wish I had my parents back
3820,2WBDSlGdr4E,Same
3821,2WBDSlGdr4E,Ni är legender!
3822,NB8yZ_Ymzpg,lets not beat around the bush he fathers a ashole kind of bloke who kills his daughter for a slight embarrassment people who worry about family shame and what others think are morons stuck in the past and the future doesn't need them

3832,NB8yZ_Ymzpg,"2 years and 10 months forward, im here watching his video with his dad on Project Iceman premiere. beautiful. 💛"
3833,NB8yZ_Ymzpg,"Why do living things continue to exist?
Of course because it continues to be made!
At the same time forcing these antonyms to continue to adorn the earth;
Beautiful - ugly
Happy - hard
Laugh - cry
Full - hungry
Life and death"
3834,NB8yZ_Ymzpg,Children are a responsibility. Having children means adding responsibility. To take care of him. And of course make him happy. Never ever have any other intention other than that.
3835,NB8yZ_Ymzpg,F*ck I'm crying. Love you guys.
3836,NB8yZ_Ymzpg,❤️
3837,NB8yZ_Ymzpg,I want to... be free
3838,NB8yZ_Ymzpg,Rewatching and again made me cry looking how far yes theory has come
3839,NB8yZ_Ymzpg,this video has the most beautiful message. it brought tears into my eyes. thank you so much
3840,NB8yZ_Ymzpg,"OMG, what an amazing short film that finally appeared on my feed as a recommendation after having watched many dozens of Yes Theory videos! 
Ammar's journey is so incredible and touching and inspirational... just wow. God bless you, guys 🙏"
3841,NB8yZ_Ymzpg,"Ammar, your story has touched more people around the world than you will ever know. A child of immigrant parents. A child with depression. A child of faith. A child of perseverance. Your story is so beautiful it brought tears to my eyes. So many of us relate to your experiences and your story. Thank you for sharing your life with the rest of us. ♥️"
3842,HjaK0zmDroc,Awwww I love her by breakfast already ❤❤
3843,HjaK0zmDroc,3:35 the home alone 2 bird lady was my favorite!!! Great reference ❤❤❤❤
3844,HjaK0zmDroc,The plaid shirt looks like SS Nazi- W/S bolts. Weird choice for the product line
3845,HjaK0zmDroc,"No fucking way, thats the paraglider from Vices 1 star reviews series, the guy goes to 1 star businesses to see if their 1 star rating is earned. This came out 2 years before the vice video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUWJX9k8QZk"
3846,HjaK0zmDroc,what's happen with the four one  i mean the boy that handled the dron lol
3847,HjaK0zmDroc,That woman is brave for meeting two strange men in a parking lot and going with them.
3848,HjaK0zmDroc,Why is nobody talking about those red X’s popping up at random times in the video?
3849,HjaK0zmDroc,I know this might be weird but what’s with the red X I saw 3 of them in the video. I also saw one on the previous video.❌❌❌
3850,HjaK0zmDroc,This is inspiring
3851,HjaK0zmDroc,How come Yes Theory ends up with the best strangers on 🤩 Kamaria's amazing!!
3852,HjaK0zmDroc,Lol the paragliding guy is the worst rated in that area. Look up 1 star reviews on vice news channel. They did an episode on him.
3853,HjaK0zmDroc,How can I start it
3854,HjaK0zmDroc,HOW ABOUT RENT A TATTOOED FRIEND.... MY FULL BACK TATTOO   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85vmTrmVDXI
3855,HjaK0zmDroc,Moonah!
3856,HjaK0zmDroc,Your videos are amazing.
3857,HjaK0zmDroc,I would not be parasailing with that man 😂
3858,HjaK0zmDroc,Can't wait to be someone friend for the day...cool stuff...everyone needs a hang out buddy sometimes....
3859,HjaK0zmDroc,omg i wanna b her friend lol
3860,HjaK0zmDroc,I enjoyed watching this. Smiled all the way through.
3861,HjaK0zmDroc,"These videos are so wholesome, my heart is full. ❤"
3862,vPKuOy7yO0s,"Needless to say, this has been an incredibly strange year. As I'm sure it has affected all of you, on our end, making videos and staying positive has been particularly challenging amongst all of the uncertainty. To make matters even more unpredictable, on his way back from practicing for a big Skydiving stunt (for the episode that was initially going to launch our podcast) Ammar got into a really bad car accident... He's better now but still very bruised and psychologically shook. Many have been asking questions about it so we wanted to put up a video to let you know that he's alright (considerably). We also still wanted to put out our podcast today. The links are in the description. Go listen and enjoy as we discuss with experts how we can better collectively deal with uncertainty, love - Thomas"
3863,vPKuOy7yO0s,"Moral of the story, he should never trust his gut instinct, as leaving the place to skydive, prematurely, almost got him killed"
3864,vPKuOy7yO0s,"I know I'm late as hell to this video, but thank God you're alive. You a good and genuine dude, and the world needs you."
3865,vPKuOy7yO0s,Hello friend  Ammar....it has taken  ME..this long  to process  ..your Shahalla  for mother..love for child.
3866,vPKuOy7yO0s,Speechless😮lovelots
3867,vPKuOy7yO0s,So so so glad you're okay Ammar ❤ Praise God 💗
3868,vPKuOy7yO0s,4:20 Facebook live reference
3869,vPKuOy7yO0s,"A very close friend of ours was the professional skydiver on a Pepsi commercial, and lost his life on that film shoot when the special rig wouldn't deploy its chute or backup chute.  Don't get complacent."
3870,vPKuOy7yO0s,"Last winter I was snowboarding and I got really good speed on one of the tracks, it was about 80-90 kmh (I measure it by a phone app) and at some point I felt like I was gonna fall and I instantly started to try to stay on the board but a couple of seconds later I thought “that’s my faith to fall here maybe” and stopped resisting and fell. Luckily I didn’t get any serious injuries (just broke my clavicle) but this feeling when you understand that something dangerous is inevitable is terrifying and magnifying at the same time. It makes you stop resisting and makes you think that “this is it, that’s the end”. It’s such a pleasant feeling, you literally find your inner peace at this moment, but I wish no one will ever face it"
3871,vPKuOy7yO0s,"Since the first time I've subscribed to Yes Theory,my only dream is to meet you Ammar. You and your friends inspire me . Yes Theory is one the reason why I still keep living 😃 thank you so much .God Bless you all !!!"
3872,vPKuOy7yO0s,"well said ammar. if you’re living life the way you want to, then even death holds no power over you"
3873,vPKuOy7yO0s,"I know what you mean by the time slowing dramatically down. When I was 17-18(?) I almost flipped my little pick up truck. I had a fever and was driving home on the backroads. The place where the pavement ended and turned into gravel, was mid curve. And I took it at 45-50mph instead of 25-30, and God kept me from crashing. Time slowed down and I saw the ground within touching distance from my window. my younger sister was absolutely traumatized and l crawled the rest of the way. Angels are real! And that was the first of many unexplainable experiences I've had."
3874,vPKuOy7yO0s,Powerful words Ammar. Thank you for sharing your experience and wisdom with us🙏🏼
3875,vPKuOy7yO0s,"Ammar i have seenu almost all of your videos in yes theory and seek discomfort, if you are ever in Tijuana send me a message so i can meet you and the rest of the guys Matt, Thomas, Tommy Cam..... it sure will be a pleasure tu meet you and shake your hand I applaud what you do and you are an easy going very nice man"
3876,vPKuOy7yO0s,Omg! This was 15 min away from my house! Looks like the 91 W to 71 N transition ramp in Corona. 7:02 Wow… glad nothing happened to you fam! 🙏🏻
3877,vPKuOy7yO0s,"Insane, intense, amazing. 🙏"
3878,vPKuOy7yO0s,I had the exact same thing happen to me yesterday and the way this guy has told his story regarding the description of how the car rolled off the road is exactly how I’ll be describing it from now on. It was the most hellish experience I’ve ever had to endure and frankly I’m a little wary of stepping into a car and driving with it again after this ordeal. I wouldn’t wish anything like this on even my own worst enemy if I had one
3879,vPKuOy7yO0s,Beautifully said.
3880,vPKuOy7yO0s,"I needed this video again today, I hate admitting it but I had gotten myself into an accident 2 months ago, completely my fault but thank the whole universe that no one was hurt. I had gotten lucky.

My current struggle right now is to figure out why I’m here, maybe rediscover my faith? Change some bad habits? I don’t know, but I stopped smoking, thats the first step I took because I don’t want life to end just yet. Thank you Ammar & Yes Theory, love you guys."
3881,vPKuOy7yO0s,"Love these guys ♥️..This is the kind of people we need more of in this world..""YES"""
3882,qYiA2YpsF8E,"It’s worth noting that what you see on both Ammar and Thomas’ shoulder is a GPS tracking our location at all times (which the rescue team and people at home are receiving). It can also text anyone immediately if anything is needed. The rescue team, although they were joking around in the video, drove back and forth on the road to keep a visual on us. They kept us always in sight and were ready to come help if anything was needed 🙏 much love and a great week y’all"
3883,qYiA2YpsF8E,Why don't u guys use si unit to measure everything in us in india we use si unit
3884,qYiA2YpsF8E,"We experienced death valley in our 72 suburban without air conditioning, somewhere around 1995, when i was a pre- teen. It was dad's idea to take us kids on these extended weekend adventures when we lived in Davis, CA. I can also recall some 115+ degree days where we spent the entire day underwater at the community pool, yes it is dry heat but past 110 it feels like a weight on your shoulders that you cant escape. Fine as a kid but dear old dad worked construction, outside in it! 
There are people all around the world who work in these extremes,  big shout out to them! 
And thanks to Yes Theory for bringing back those memories for me!"
3885,qYiA2YpsF8E,"Having experienced Doha in summer, 46 degrees C with 98% humidity. I couldn't walk under 1k to the mall at 2am without feeling like I couldn't breathe. I honestly think they have next level endurance for this. Absolutely so impressive!"
3886,qYiA2YpsF8E,Still binge watching 😀-2 years backwards
3887,qYiA2YpsF8E,reminded me of that breaking bad and bcs episode
3888,qYiA2YpsF8E,"As this temperatures hits Europe and America only thing i can think about is how we dont even try to solve it, not politicians nor civilians, isnt it time to fight this?"
3889,qYiA2YpsF8E,Something to look forward to in a few decades 😂
3890,qYiA2YpsF8E,Being exposed to such extreme heat is very dangerous and your body could react differently and end up having a brain damage
3891,qYiA2YpsF8E,"Next time mention Celsius too, cuz I don't understand how hot it was 😂"
3892,qYiA2YpsF8E,Okay darlings you do not have to court death to entertain us! Please don't try that again.
3893,qYiA2YpsF8E,As someone from Phoenix I can confirm you're not missing out on much
3894,qYiA2YpsF8E,These dudes wouldn’t survive pipeline 130 is nothing and just 2 hours 🤣Boiii!!! Lmao try 10 in the pipeline
3895,qYiA2YpsF8E,"Hahahah what!!!! You think that's hot enough
Come to Iraq dude"
3896,qYiA2YpsF8E,Death Valley is gorgeous. It was about 120 when I was there. We filled a box with sand before we left and 5 hours later at home it was still hot.
3897,qYiA2YpsF8E,"drove through the outskirts of death valley in June back in 2007. It was 124 degrees. Stopped at a gas station to stock up on water just in case for the engine of my Jeep Grand Cherokee. Just in case. The guy said, ""oh it's not too bad today""....


124 degrees. That was a ""not to bad day"". 

Yeah. It was by far the hottest I've been in. I once golfed in Phoenix in late August and it was 117 degrees by 3 PM. At that time that was the hottest weather I'd ever done anything in. And it's not like I don't know heat. Where I live, it gets 105 degrees some days in the summer. But the diffence from 100 to 117 then to the mid 120s is insane."
3898,qYiA2YpsF8E,just go to phillipines 😂
3899,qYiA2YpsF8E,Filipinos: first time?
3900,qYiA2YpsF8E,Iraq gets as hot and western africa gets even hotter
3901,qYiA2YpsF8E,When people say they rather be hot vs cold 😂 legit put them in a survival situation between hot and cold and I bet you most will say surviving in cold is easier .

3922,Vh4O04Bpovw,"Thank you for allowing us to continue doing good with our platform and with Seek Discomfort. I know brands always say ""We're in this together!"" type of stuff but we do genuinely feel a responsibility towards the community to shine a light on positive stories and create a ripple effect of change in whatever capacity we can. So we're excited you're along for the ride and so curious to see where the rest of the year can take us :)"
3923,Vh4O04Bpovw,Wow. Future space treehuggers!!!
3924,Vh4O04Bpovw,it is a very interesting place.  I have a buddy here in AZ whose company had the window cleaning contract with Biosphere2 about 15 years ago.
3925,Vh4O04Bpovw,"The documentary was called 'Bio-Dome' very interesting, you should all check it out. Its about love, respect, and sustainability."
3926,Vh4O04Bpovw,Beautiful 😍

It's was completely closed of for yrs, but there were some periphery homes that we reconned!

We weren't allowed entry, but samples were needed, and dad was one of the field agents collecting samples to send for toxicity testing! 

There are many abandoned sites that just hold a certain degree of mystique, that draw that draw the curious!❤"

3934,Vh4O04Bpovw,I've definitely got to watch Bio-Dome after this.
3935,Vh4O04Bpovw,Wow to the biosphere
3936,Vh4O04Bpovw,"I am sorry but I refuse to support racism, thanks to your support of black lives matter, you have lost me as a subscriber. ALL HUMAN LIVES MATTER, and anything less then that is the definition of racism. The fact is all human lives are important, and whenever one race is singled out, over a long enough time period it will lead to the same racism. Look at South Africa, apartheid was just flipped around, now white people are the oppressed and marginalized, so any kind of favoring of any race only leads to more racism. 

For anyone else who reads this, and tells me the whites of south africa deserve this injustice, then I will kindly tell you to go and tell that to the people who were born after 1994, go to a three year old white child living in a shanty town, and tell them that they deserve this injustice, go and tell that to the innocent and see if you can accept that. No one deserves to live in a shanty town, no human is worth so little that they can be marginalized under any circumstances."

3964,QTOGyd1ddvI,I’ve been obsessed with the idea of going to Brazil since I was a child. Going to Carnival in Rio de Janeiro like in the worlds biggest party video is goals

And Carnaval in Bahia is 5 times bigger than Rio's. and a Billion times better.
The carnaval in Rio started with the intent to show the southeast the beauties of Carnaval na Bahia, so rio's carnaval is just a parade simulating the real party."
3972,QTOGyd1ddvI,I want this penthouse with the roof garden!

3982,7FdGA-NefJo,"Hey everyone... The past few months we closed in. We were having a hard time but couldn’t find a way to share it. Arriving at 5 years of Yes Theory we decided to stop and ask ourselves challenging questions about what we wanted for the future. We’re now arriving at a much better place mentally, physically and amongst each other and are excited to reconnect with all of you 🙏

WE WILL BE BACK STRONGER 💪"
3983,7FdGA-NefJo,😇Have a Great Day. Greetings from Kapiso Mo Vlog Family❤️ Thank You for sharing this video Im glad Im here❤️Keep uploading your video and stay safe. Godbless😇 7:06
3984,7FdGA-NefJo,We all have the same ability to make things for ourselves. Don’t buy into the blm bs
3985,7FdGA-NefJo,I'm here I had to re watch the video ND we are here stay strong brother from California
3986,7FdGA-NefJo,oh habibi im just waiting for you and your team to pop up ...always here ...
3987,7FdGA-NefJo,❤
3988,7FdGA-NefJo,"You should never feel about having “first world problems”. No matter who you are, there is always someone out there who you may deem has it harder than you. But that does not diminish your right to feel whatever you feel, since we each live within our own framework of the world"
3989,7FdGA-NefJo,"What helped me to stay positive in 2020 was doing a 40 day social media detox in April 2020, which led me to do a summer long social media detox. After that I was guided to delete all my social media accounts in September 2020 (Facebook, Instagram & SnapChat). I am so grateful for making those decisions, I felt it was Divinely guided. ~Sheri Bo Berry 🍓"
3990,7FdGA-NefJo,"I'm Watching this 2 years down the road from when you filmed it, but It sounds like you missed the point of what you all do. Covid may have given you some restrictions but it was a time when your joy and positivity and the fun-filled interactions that you share with one another should have shone. I have not seen all of your work during covid but I have no doubt you found your way. I'm probably way too old to be watching Yes Theory lol but it has inspired me to just keep going at times. You are a great bunch of guys and your passion for life is immeasurable. I do want to challenge you on another note but I will save that for an email 😉."
3991,7FdGA-NefJo,Dear Thomas Its hard for me to know that I wont see any of you guys  for a while I hope that where ever you guys go that you will feel us up with what and where you are and how you guys are doing I know I will be missing you a lot with the humorous character that you are and have .I am very sorry but its hard for me not seeing you and other guys together  what a loss for Youtube America  not having your Yes Theory  program  I definitely will miss you I am Saddened Thomas  Love all of you and Good luck God Bless you in every thing that you guys are doing I will keep you in my prayers
3992,7FdGA-NefJo,Yeah no look into blm and where the money is going to. It's a joke. Love this channel but really looking into what's actually happening us a problem
3993,7FdGA-NefJo,"With a tear in my eye... I can honestly tell you I 've missed you guys more than anyone on the internet. When Matt decided to leave, it broke my heart, more than it did when he completed Ironman. You guys give new meaning to 'give somebody something by way of the internet'.
I know of no other you tubers who give of themselves more than you do. With sincereity. I pray you guys at least stay together as an organization, because you benefit mankind moreso than alot of entities whose soul mission is to help people. You actually HELP people by giving them hope and inspiration.
I'm VERY low income, a n.v d I can't wait for the day I can order my Seek Discomfort shirt. Thank you for all you've done for people, personally and by osmosis. You have done so much by simply just inspiring them to be better. For themselves, if not others.
Thanks hardly seems appropriate.
But, THANKS. And God bless and keep you great bunch of guys  together, you've done so much already, can't wait what the future brings, for you, and the rest of the world you're trying to improve. 
God Bless and Keep you each and every one. 🙏💜🌹💪😎👍"
3994,7FdGA-NefJo,I just realized that you got wonderful eyebrows.... Thomas ^_^
3995,7FdGA-NefJo,"I appreciate you, Thomas, being so forthcoming and honest with the state of YesTheory. Authenticity is high up there on my list of values. You all have them in spades. Thank you all for what you do. I did not see the link to subscribe to the newsletter, but I will find it. Thank you all for what you do."
3996,7FdGA-NefJo,This video really shows that you guys are really down to earth and that after your successes with this channel. This is really impressive.
3997,7FdGA-NefJo,how i wish i can meet you all one day
3998,7FdGA-NefJo,"The fact that you realized that you are enjoying a lot of privileges in the midst of the pandemic and became sensitive of what's going on around you, you guys are more than just a youtube channel. You guys are making not no-nonsense fun vids but  fun and inspiring ones. Kudos! New subscriber here and have been  binge watching your vids these past days 😊"
3999,7FdGA-NefJo,If only we have the word to describe the feeling...
4000,7FdGA-NefJo,"Every Yes Theory member including editors and past members, my heart goes out to you fellas/femellas and the good you put back into the world. Keep kickin ass!"
4001,7FdGA-NefJo,"Almost all Religions say that we should live a happy and positive life. Now that is not always possible because life is a wheel. Sometimes you're up. Sometimes you are down. 

Now I know that for some Channels (like Yes Theory) who tries to spread positivity on this time appears rubbing salt on the wound or for some just a group of people ignoring other people's plights but really it isn't.

People have different motions. Different rhythms. Some need encouragements. Others just need alone time to focus on their situation. If some people are offended by Yes Theory because of ""untimely"" release of content, that's fine. Maybe you can opt not to watch for now.

Because other people needs them. It might not be all but there will be people who need their content at these trying times. It is not just religion we can hold on to. And maybe for some, Yes Theory is their God's answer to their sorrow."
4002,_zEM6Fc-7NI,❤❤❤
4003,_zEM6Fc-7NI,Lmao what a joke.
4004,_zEM6Fc-7NI,"We should copy that and think about it. If somone say some bad words to your sons, you can fight back easily, but you will not do that. Who is stronger, the answer is super clear."

4007,_zEM6Fc-7NI,Good

4010,_zEM6Fc-7NI,Funny that the BLM organization bought a 6m$ mansion in LA with the money raised the last year. Maybe in this 6m$ there was also your money🤷🏻‍♂️
4011,_zEM6Fc-7NI,🤡
4012,_zEM6Fc-7NI,Lol oh god BLM is an absolute joke. Skin color makes zero difference. Stats PROVE EVERYTHING they say is a lie. Shut up with your hate and lies.
4013,_zEM6Fc-7NI,Motte and bailey fallacy
4014,_zEM6Fc-7NI,To bad The whole BLM movement is so selective and is getting feed by the media
4015,_zEM6Fc-7NI,Thank you for being there and giving another strong voice to this.  Black Lives Matter!
4016,_zEM6Fc-7NI,"As of 5 Sept 2020, this video just reached 956,557 views. Hmm..I wonder why 🤔"
4017,_zEM6Fc-7NI,"Was sickened by the George Floyd killing. Want to join in making everyone feel the laws we have are for all people. But I can't join this. 

The mother telling her small son he's never gong to be seen the same as another white kid?  

The soilder speaking out about he's not as good in others eyes? The young white girl dating she needs to stand in front of a black man because he's more at risk from police?  So many others who spoke. Protest yes but know the truth.

Don't do this 

https://youtu.be/0HZcUjF510U"
4018,_zEM6Fc-7NI,damn the little kids being forced to go
4019,_zEM6Fc-7NI,"dont join those moronic ""protests""... yall are smarter than this bs propaganda smh"
4020,_zEM6Fc-7NI,"Police kill more white people than white people just stop this, all lives matter."
4021,_zEM6Fc-7NI,It’s not about looking at everyone as the same. Learn about other cultures and have a better understanding of where other ppl who don’t look like you may have come from and what they can face because of where they come from - this includes their skin color. And be aware of privileges you have in order to help others that do not have those privileges.

4057,-rVzVEfleQg,"Man. I have tear drops on the reaction of the three after watching the video for the first time.

God bless you all for letting me witness it all."
4058,-rVzVEfleQg,Aloha family! I am a 61 year young woman that feels so much joy from watching your videos. I’m not on social media any longer so I can’t leave a message there. I have so much gratitude for just experiencing these smiles and joy you bring to everyone. Thank you!

4100,sX97g2HyZ_c,"While it's wonderful and positive to come together, we as humanity need to understand, wake up and realize...the globalists who run the world are doing us at home, on purpose...destroying the world economy behind a facade of a ""plandemic"" to change the currency, to a credit system, with a i.d. on each of us...COVID-19 stands for Certification of vaccination i.d....it's crazy, but it's true...i hope people in yes theory and the yes theory community start to look into this...""operation lockstep"" is a real simulation made in 2012 and it's on the rockefeller foundation's page of what they would do in a ""pandemic"" and it's to the letter. This virus is not what they made it out to be. Is it real? yes, but it has a very small kill rate, less than the flu....DO NOT TAKE THE VACCINATION, IT'S THE MARK OF THE BEAST...whether you believe in God/end times or not, it is still about implanting a chip that will contol you or getting a tatoo that has a permanent i.d. on you...wake up world...real shit is going down...look up agenda 2030 as well...it claims to ""save the earth"" but it's really about losing freedoms and choices...i love yes theory but there will be no yes theory without a real wake up to the world"

4110,hfVwG6-pigk,Jesus loves you he died for us he has a purpose for you you had a purpose for you before you were even born he loves you the creator of the world knows your name you should be happy with that thank God every day that he woke you up that he sent his one and only son on the cross so those that believe in him shall not Parrish but have eternal life Jesus loves you except him into your life today Lord Jesus I ask you watch over everyone that is reading this God bless them in Jesus name protect them father God in Jesus name I pray amen

4141,Tk3jSymElZs,"Hey guys, cool vid.
If u have spare money to spend, you guys could look into buying large pockets of land that are old growth forests and turning them into nature reserves..  Protecting the land for future gens, before it all gets cleared. Steve Erwin, the Crocodile hunter used to do that..  It's the best money spent.
All the best for a long life lived with honour & grace.

4142,_pjFonS2USI,Let’s start a ripple effect of kindness together 🙏
4143,_pjFonS2USI,Just watching this again years later 💛💛💛 So good!
4144,_pjFonS2USI,Great video as always!
4145,_pjFonS2USI,Heartwarming❤
4146,_pjFonS2USI,i think Ammar is inside Minnie mouse
4147,_pjFonS2USI,My dad told me that.   Nervousness is excitement.  As an actress I've had to remind myself that every performance. How cool he READ that.  Dad!!!
4148,_pjFonS2USI,"How can you not love Yes Theory or support seek discomfort... this isn't a paid for like, just what yes theory gives back randomly deserves supporting."

4159,_pjFonS2USI,What's even sweeter is that she chose her mother's favorite spot as the upgrade; she really is a selfless gem 💎
4160,_pjFonS2USI,I really need this
4161,_pjFonS2USI,"I've always tried to give to people! My favorite thing was being wheels for the main person in Pay it Forward Redmond. I went on so many adventures! I made food drops that were literally on the street that butts up with tent city in BLM. I miss Susan Troncoso her death was detrimental to the animals in Central Oregon! Giving to people for her got me through the darkest time of my life! Now I live in a totally different town so I'm starting to get connected to helping here! I work with an incredible unit that does magic with people's wounds! Now to just meet these incredible young men that have created some amazing acts of kindness! My husband and I bought my dream house that literally has both of my favorite places to go to growing up. My Grandparents house, and my Uncle's house! It's old but in pretty good shape! I literally went down the hallway rubbing the poor walls promising to give this house the much needed love!"
4162,vZUwAL4CulE,New Seek Discomfort drop is live now 🤘 https://www.seekdiscomfort.com
4163,vZUwAL4CulE,Who's here after the matt's new deal on the latest yes theory video 🤣
4164,vZUwAL4CulE,"I’m clapping in my apartment, alone, for you Matt!!"
4165,vZUwAL4CulE,"I've never tried a backflip. At 71, I doubt I'll ever start?"
4166,vZUwAL4CulE,My friend died after he did a backflip … you shouldn’t attempt again
4167,vZUwAL4CulE,Is part 2 out?
4168,vZUwAL4CulE,What ever happened? was there a Part 2?
4169,vZUwAL4CulE,Coward Matt quit being in front of the camera like a big baby
4170,vZUwAL4CulE,"The worst part is. He could easily do a backflip. If he had better teachers. The flippers allowing him to flip on cement when he was not landing it on his own on sand was beyond irresponsible. On his 2nd to last attempt pasha basically held him in the air. So as a teacher, he should NOT have allowed mat to try it without a spot"
4171,vZUwAL4CulE,2 years and I still haven't seen part 2. LOLL
4172,vZUwAL4CulE,Where is part 2?
4173,vZUwAL4CulE,This is too dangerous Matt 😢
4174,vZUwAL4CulE,💚
4175,vZUwAL4CulE,Where's part 2?
4176,vZUwAL4CulE,Who's still waiting for part 2?
4177,vZUwAL4CulE,Always practice backflips in water to avoid injuries
4178,vZUwAL4CulE,Waiting for the part 2
4179,vZUwAL4CulE,dont try dis
4180,vZUwAL4CulE,that childhood incident explains a lot.
4181,vZUwAL4CulE,Sooooo is there a part 2 or am I having a bad search?
4182,PRWNePX7HJo,What's your favorite first date ideas? 🤔(just asking for a friend)
4183,PRWNePX7HJo,Somebody make this date into a music video
4184,PRWNePX7HJo,"Absolutely amazing, love this idea so much!"
4185,PRWNePX7HJo,Luvved this!
4186,PRWNePX7HJo,Are they a couple now?
4187,PRWNePX7HJo,You‘re heros
4188,PRWNePX7HJo,Tha fact that Matt has the Ad spot at the end absolutely killed me. ☠️🤣
4189,PRWNePX7HJo,When a kid can set up dates better than adults it just says everything!!
4190,PRWNePX7HJo,How fake can an episode be?😂😂
4191,PRWNePX7HJo,ok can i get an update of this guys?
4192,PRWNePX7HJo,what happened afterwards?
4193,PRWNePX7HJo,"I think this is a great idea for a first date!  It takes the pressure out of planning a perfect date (if you don't enjoy it, you can just blame it on the cute kid), and it generates a lot of laughter and great memories that you can talk about (hopefully) on the second date.  But good on Sage for being such a good sport."
4194,PRWNePX7HJo,Thomas' storytelling is unreal
4195,PRWNePX7HJo,"Yes Theory organs:
Matt: Brains
Ammar: Heart
Thomas: Soul"
4196,PRWNePX7HJo,ngl they look like a cute small family ❤❤❤❤
4197,PRWNePX7HJo,I hope parker stays 5 forever this innocent child cuteness just makes you believe in humanity
4198,PRWNePX7HJo,This could’ve been a very different video if it was a 15 year old instead of a 5 year old planing this date
4199,PRWNePX7HJo,Ammar is so good with kids it’s adorable
4200,PRWNePX7HJo,YOOO SAGE FROM VALORANT
4201,PRWNePX7HJo,ADORABLE!!!!
4202,kYiC8lzpTyM,"Grateful to have crossed paths with you Xavier, may you Rest In Peace"
4203,kYiC8lzpTyM,"Matt, you are such a special person and have a gift. I hope you continue to learn about yourself and thrive in your life. This was a beautiful video."
4204,kYiC8lzpTyM,"I'm not usually an emotional person, but the last few minutes of this video never fails to make me cry. Thank you Matt and to the Yes Theory team for sharing the story of this wonderful young man. And to his amazing family - thank you for showing the world what it truly means to love unconditionally."
4205,kYiC8lzpTyM,"""There's a lot of people who reach a goal and say 'ok, I'm good'. For me that isn't an option""...fuck man. That hit me."
4206,kYiC8lzpTyM,I have been crying and still crying watching this .... have no words except for love.
4207,kYiC8lzpTyM,♥️💜
4208,kYiC8lzpTyM,"The video that broke Matt. I’m gonna miss him so much when he leaves, he has the greatest heart"
4209,kYiC8lzpTyM,"If it's that important to have him there, then I don't get why they wouldn't have moved the wedding so it's within a short distance to where the brother is. I'm confused"
4210,kYiC8lzpTyM,"this guy was all style and dignity under the most incomprehensible bad luck, thank god his story and strength wasnt lost and will shine on"
4211,kYiC8lzpTyM,"at 54 i heard the same news i was a little bit like ""OK Well i made a half century' but i was mostly pissed off and angry, with ""i didnt smoke i havent had a drink since my 20s i exercised ate right"" but i had half a century and i still fell shattered so whats it like when not even a quarter of a century, it must be incomprehensible to someone who was a kid 3 years before getting diagnosed"
4212,kYiC8lzpTyM,"😮 I have been so consumed with Xavier 24:23 that I ALMOST forgot Stephanie and her now husband, and what this process could possibly even mean to her personally. And I apologize for that. I don’t like to read ahead, but I feel like I know where this is heading and I just want to send all of my love to all of the families. I want to say so much more but I know this is not the place and probably nobody except other viewers. Will see this but gosh.❤❤❤❤❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹"
4213,kYiC8lzpTyM,"If travel/transportation were more economical than families could be reunited, and people could say yes to more things and experience more Yes opportunities, then I think worldwide people would understand each other more, even if we don’t speak the same languages. Sending love to you and yours from Orlando, Florida, USA."
4214,kYiC8lzpTyM,"Awwww Luke, 15:40 what a guy ❤❤❤"
4215,kYiC8lzpTyM,😭 ❤ Xavier 8:33  I’m crying and you will forever be loved
4216,kYiC8lzpTyM,Matt just stay in Yes Theory Fam. Don’t leave. just don’t leave.
4217,kYiC8lzpTyM,"For all the vidoes i have watched on this channel, this one is by far, the most unique and carefully filmed that shows the sense of humanity that we all need to show towards each other. Matt and the Yes Theory Team literally captured significant moments in the last four months of Xavier's  life. Thank you Matt, for telling his story! Love from Ghana❤"
4218,kYiC8lzpTyM,"Hey, team. I am writing this from the bottom of my heart. Firstly, I absolutely love what you guys did, do and are doing. I've seen this video so many times but this time watching it was different and I am writing this as I re-watch it. I am in a difficult emotional state, and as I was watching this video I started crying and as i got deeper into the video it made me realise my purpose in life. This video inspired me to go out there and start giving back to the people around us. Even if it is as simple as putting a smile for one second on a person's face, that moment is worth cherishing for an entire lifetime. Watching this video made me realise the joy of giving back. I am so inspired by what you guys did for Xavier and I wish to do the same for everyone who are struggling in life. By the means of this comment I'd like to extend my heartfelt gratitude and thanks for inspiring me to do something greater than life. @Yes Theory and the entire team is doing a wonderful job. You guys are gonna be remembered as legends. Also, I am from India, if there's anything I could ever do to help you or anyone who's in need of any sort of help, do reach out to me. I would love it if I could make someone's day a tad bit better. 
Regards
Thanking you"
4219,kYiC8lzpTyM,❤❤❤
4220,kYiC8lzpTyM,"Rest in peace Xavier, and I hope his family is doing well despite the loss because I'm sure that's what Xavier would want as well."
4221,kYiC8lzpTyM,"I didn't think that I would finish watching this with a smile, albeit a bittersweet one. A great aunt of mine passed not long before her niece's (my mums cousin's) wedding and although we knew she wouldn't be able to attend the wedding beforehand, there was almost a sense of relief that she was no longer suffering and rather than missing her presence her memory was celebrated 🩵"
4222,SCdA1QnbFOc,Fair few farm / back country roads in New Zealand which can be similar
4223,SCdA1QnbFOc,thats our everyday road here in  hill region of India haha just kidding
4224,SCdA1QnbFOc,"@YesTheory
Please make a video on chang la pass India which is one of the most dangerous road in the world"
4225,SCdA1QnbFOc,"My only question is is it a one-way road? If not, then how the hell?!"
4226,SCdA1QnbFOc,That road is abosulely bonkers! Had vertigo just watching that. I take my hat off to the engineers who built it.
4227,SCdA1QnbFOc,wow beautiful country
4228,SCdA1QnbFOc,That death road gave me flashbacks to the time I drove across the Atlas mountains. It had roads similar to this. Being a passenger is absolutely terrifying
4229,SCdA1QnbFOc,Gotta love how the elitist hypocrites justify their polluting of the earth.
4230,SCdA1QnbFOc,"Joe Mama joke, most replayed as it should be"
4231,SCdA1QnbFOc,"sorry but ""carbon footprint"" is a scam . its an idea from BIG OIL to blame u for ur consumption of goodS , rather than blaming themselves, LIKE ARE U SERIOUS. VIRTUESIGNALING.. :D"
4232,SCdA1QnbFOc,Hermosa Bolivia que tiene cultura su música danzas hermosos lugares naturales para conocer excelente vídeo de mi país .
4233,SCdA1QnbFOc,"1:10 being mindful of fossil fuel consumption by travelling, using plastic and very expensive brands. This hypocritical idea of being conscious but consuming everything that is new at the same time…"
4234,SCdA1QnbFOc,❤❤❤
4235,SCdA1QnbFOc,Haha there is a road in my city that looks almost identical
4236,SCdA1QnbFOc,"The World’s Most Dangerous Road title is of ""Fairy Meadows Road"". It is the name of a spectacular and dangerous high mountain track located in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan. One false move and it’s a very long drop. I bet if you guys travel there you will find it at least 10 times more dangerous of this Bolivian road. After the end of the road the view of famous ""Nanga Perbat"" mountain will mesmerize you."
4237,SCdA1QnbFOc,"Dude, the carbon footprint was invented by BP!"
4238,SCdA1QnbFOc,There is a Guardrail! @ 12:11
4239,SCdA1QnbFOc,that looks like the same view from that kevin cosner movie Dragon FLy
4240,SCdA1QnbFOc,wow that a long and scary road with no guard rail.. my friend took me to white mountain in NH and he drove us to the top and the roads had no guard rail either... it was windy and scarey to me when we got to the top the buildings are held there by big chains cause it gets so windy and in the winter is one of the coldest places on earth.  this reminds me of that day
4241,SCdA1QnbFOc,The bleached reefs have already adapted and come back. Stay on top of your research. Stop buying into everything.
4242,a_VDd84PWGA,"So...should we make this our next documentary or not?!  Comment if you want to see an hour long version of this epic drama ;)  And for those of you who are saying they'd buy a cake boy shirt, we're actually putting them up on seekdiscomfort.com for the next 72 hours along with our new January drop, so check it out before it's too late!  Love you all and trust me...Cake Boy will rise again..."

4253,a_VDd84PWGA,"Yes Theory! Please take down all vids with Will Smith, if you actually stand for what you guys preach and share with your community. Thanks"
4254,a_VDd84PWGA,"this was great guys! Cake Boy! HAHA!! What acting too! I love the lighting, someone knows what they are doing!! 🤓"
4255,a_VDd84PWGA,This video is hilarious 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
4256,a_VDd84PWGA,I was pretty disappointed back when this happened. I think he really deserved the movie credit.
4257,a_VDd84PWGA,"should of renamed the movie to cake boy for life... in memory of cake boy.....the man, the myth, the legend..."

4261,a_VDd84PWGA,"“Cake-tastrophe” and the merch was hilarious. 
Thomas, you would’ve made a good movie great!! 🐑🐑🇳🇿🇳🇿"
4262,O6UedmnRJc0,So grass-fed beef is no good? Isn't there lots of science regarding how there's lots of good things in it for you? Lots of people healing disease on keto I feel like I would be starving as the meat is so satisfying
4263,O6UedmnRJc0,"You literally look like you are glowing by the end, more light hearted and more enthusiastic .  That says a lot to me . Great video! Thank you."
4264,O6UedmnRJc0,"I find it interesting that there are those on both sides... I'll say vegetarian vs carnivor as vegan is more of an ideology than a diet... Could it in part be that the act of paying attention to eating whole foods over processed is the primary key. If we compare anyone who is focusing on eating well to someone who is eating the SAD, it doesn't seem to matter that the testimony is from a vegetarian or a carnivor, there's a net benefit for the majority of people on both sides. How about we meet in the middle and stop the SAD, versus diving only into one side or the other... Humans are omnivores, not crapnivores... let's just not be deficient in any nutrients and be healthy diet omnivores. Time to start hardcore looking into the best omnivore diet."
4265,O6UedmnRJc0,All diets that require supplements are unhealthy.
4266,O6UedmnRJc0,"Good to hear you tried vegan all-carb diet for 30 days, much better than the SAD.  Now to truly be shocked try the carnivore zero-carb diet for 30 days."
4267,O6UedmnRJc0,I went vegan 11 years ago and it’s still the best decision I’ve ever made about my health and happiness.
4268,O6UedmnRJc0,"The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics warns of the risk of vitamin B12 deficiencies in vegetarians and vegans. Vitamin B12 is found naturally only in animal products. A lack of vitamin B12 can lead to anemia and blindness. It can also cause muscle weakness, tingling, and numbness."
4269,O6UedmnRJc0,"A retarded life style my grand parents live all more than 85 years eating a lot of meat and my neightbour göt cancer and died at 63 nevěř eating meat, shitest manipulation ever The legumes u eat göt a lot of pesticides on them and are moře cancerous than meat 10 Times if pur stomch have The enzime to digest meat than means ıts eating meat iş apart of US regardeless we canot digest cellulosis"
4270,O6UedmnRJc0,So you took supplements... that's kinda cheating and it's even worse if you don't really mention this in the video.
4271,O6UedmnRJc0,"These days I am mostly off all processed foods and 85 to 90% vegan. I really don’t sweat it if I’m out of friends or out, the processed food and eating plants in their natural form really does seem to be key for me."
4272,O6UedmnRJc0,Yes! Starving is good for you !
4273,O6UedmnRJc0,How many meals do Vegan eat?
4274,O6UedmnRJc0,"I am a Pestarcian,
I may go Vegan one day.
How can I give up Fish?"
4275,O6UedmnRJc0,"I have been plant based for about 5 years and I don’t have to think about what need to be eating anymore, because once you skipped the beginning stage of learning and adjusting, it becomes natural to just eat the right things and be fully satisfied and healthy. 
Many say veganism is restricting, but I don’t experience it that way at all, because eating the corpse of an animal or any other animal product wasn’t something I had consent to consume, I was crossing their boundaries, not hurting my own. Therefore I am content with my plant based diet, I don’t think about what I cannot eat because it isn’t crossing my mind anymore. I am moving freely in my space, trying my best to be mindful. 
Sure, the umami flavour of meat is delicious, but that can be easily achieved through mushrooms or other. 

If you have the accessibility to go on a plant based diet, I would highly recommend it, for ethical, health and environmental reasons.

And plant based food is delicious as fuck, there is so much to try and such a vast pool of receptors and ingredients to choose from.

Dietary wise, eating animal products are fine to eat, as discussed in the video. But ethics and climate change could be the weights to make a decision pro plant based eating."
4276,O6UedmnRJc0,Meat diets are good for buliding muscle and strength but damn when i was vegan i was never tired!
4277,O6UedmnRJc0,Meat is actually beneficial for us. New studies have proven this.
4278,O6UedmnRJc0,I just gone Pescetarian while still incorporating vegan food. I'm on day 3 and I feel so good. I can't seem to digest meat but I can with seafood. I wonder it will clear up my seborrheic dermatitis.
4279,O6UedmnRJc0,"It appears that any diet that excludes sugar, processed foods, hydrogenated seed oils and corn syrup clears up most conditions and enables weight loss. So the issue isn't so much which diet to choose as staying away from the non-food products industry is selling us. I went on a whole plant based diet to try to lose weight for four months, and while I didn't lose weight, a chronic heel/foot problem I had cleared up. I had that problem for 3 years, and was limping in pain constantly. My painful wrists cleared up, too, from sprains a few years ago. Processed foods are worse for us that we can imagine. And that goes for takeout food, too. I didn't stay on it, but focused on whole foods for most of my diet, and my foot (feet) problem never returned. The wrists did, but not to the degree it had been."
4280,O6UedmnRJc0,Vegan since 20 yrs here...Still alive ;))
4281,O6UedmnRJc0,"i cheered and shouted when he went to the grocery store and start loading his basket up with fruits and veggies! I’ve been whole food plant-based for the last 7 years and cannot imagine ever going back! Weight down 60 pounds, cholesterol down 10 points, blood pressure down 20 points, and my A1c is 4.8! He does talk about how hard it is to have to think about your food this much . Sad, but True. But, if I’m not thinking about it, McDonalds is doing the thinking for me!"
4282,ysj2X0zNtSs,"What's the discomfort you need to pursue in 2020? 


2019 was both a challenging and an incredible year for us. We learned a lifetime's worth of lessons and are ending the year with so much gratitude for our audience.

4321,BHuK8BdVCV4,""" positivity is a choice "" - Thomas Brag"
4322,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,"Thanks for watching! Despite what you might see in the video, Bhutan was actually quite challenging for me to travel to. The trip was planned very last minute so I didn't have time to do much research, I was still jet-lagged from the 14-hr time difference and the elevation was having weird effects on my headspace. But I pushed through even though filming alone in these conditions makes it so much harder to bring positive energy into it. Sitting down with the ex-Prime Minister and hiking to Tiger's Nest completely changed everything in the end however.


I'm on a bit of a personal journey of understanding what the fundamental parameters of joy truly are, so going on a trip like this had quite of a profound effect on me in the end. Hope you got something out of it and looking forward to capturing more of the world's beauty. - Thomas"
4323,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,Thank you for coming to our country 😊😊😊😊
4324,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,Wow very cool 😎
4325,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,Ours common oil subsidy is a fraudulent enterprise used to enrich people within and outside the government. They have stopped it and still mismanaging it. I am proud of Bhuda. And ashamed of my country - Nigeria.
4326,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,That ex prime minister was so cool
4327,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,Bhutannn. 😀😀😀😀😀
4328,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,"Grown up hearing all about bhutan, and never in my decades of years of existing had i heard about the D part of their culture. Omg 😂"
4329,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,Hi
4330,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,UR AWESOME BRO. GOD BLESS U MORE
4331,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,Amazing places 👏👏👏
4332,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,Oww😀
4333,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,I was born in Bhutan 🇧🇹 ❤
4334,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,"i just watched this. every spiritual places, have positive energy emitted from it, you can really feel it seep into your soul and makes your heart and brain calmer and sometimes (believe or not), the positive energy transmitted to your passed away relatives and it emits back to you."
4335,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,Anyone who can pay for a trip for me to Bhutan😢? I really would like to travel to different places especially after losing my mom and grandma
4336,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,hahahahahaahahahahaa
4337,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,https://youtube.com/@SHOHA19?si=uTTha1B7PMryzF5c
4338,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,The tour guide blushing at meeting the ex prime minister is so wholesome😊
4339,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,Bhutan is happiest country in the world coz peaceful community is not living there in large numbers
4340,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,As per the prophecy of Guru Padmasambhava who was the lotus born and who never died as per record. He said that he will return back during the degenarated times as the king of  shambala. Bhutan is known as shangrila which is misspelling of shambala the hidden land of guru rinpoche aka (baeyul).
4341,Qmi-Xwq-MEc,No one watched my vlogs

4344,rQHaJBMf-p8,Anyone know the name of the music at 18mins? Shazam has failed me
4345,rQHaJBMf-p8,"6:18 I’m sure it wasn’t intentional, but that SS in the “less” on his jacket sure does look bad."
4346,rQHaJBMf-p8,What happens to people after they make their dreams happen? Move on to something else? There really isn't any topping a triathlon in Antarctica and he is so young. I'm 33 and did everything I wanted to accomplish already and feel so bored now. Guess I didn't have big enough dreams 😂😂😂

4352,rQHaJBMf-p8,"Bought the movie, and have to say its the most inspirational thing I've ever watched. Would 100% recommend to absolutely anyone."
4353,rQHaJBMf-p8,"Iam egyptian and i am very proud of you ammar ...you look like our ancestors the great pharores..they conquered all the old world and built a great civilization ...now you do that but in content creation 
You are a great egyptian king"
4354,rQHaJBMf-p8,Rewatching this after seeing the movie 🩵🩵🩵
4355,rQHaJBMf-p8,"After the movie. Coming back here just feels surreal. Having watched this video back then, the journey almost feels like its our own but at the same time cannot begin to comprehend the effort and sacrifice it takes to get this done."
4356,rQHaJBMf-p8,Seek Discomfort has been a motto of mine from the time I started following Yes Theory. That's how impactful you're to others so Thank you.
4357,rQHaJBMf-p8,"after watching the last premiere in Amsterdam, I had to come back and watch again where it all started for us (the viewers). When I first watched this 3,5 years ago, I could had never imagined that I would had attended one of the premiers, meet Anders and the whole team. I truly wish that whoever reads this comment will have the chance in his life to meet the yes theory team because they are truly amazing also in real life. Definitely the best encounter I've had with influencers🩵💙"
4358,rQHaJBMf-p8,"I love each and every video you guys make... Ahum, but... their is so much background music involved in each video I can't binch-watch or truly enjoy the essence of the video. It's like looking at a music-video with soft music. I'm sorry... Hope you don't mind my personal experience on the video's; I love them and i keep coming back to get inspired."
4359,rQHaJBMf-p8,Every video is so inspiring. THANK YOU. I feel more connected than ever to your content and to the world.
4360,rQHaJBMf-p8,"@seekdiscomfort @yestheory

How do I go about watching this movie? I'd love to do so as this story is so inspiring, but missed the window when it was in theaters. Any help or point in the right direction would be much appreciated. Thanks 🙏"
4361,rQHaJBMf-p8,I mean telling him you're gonna sponsor him does imply you're gonna give him money
4362,dbmrOy65cNw,"Don’t miss the new drop! Biggest Collection we’ve ever made. If you need a holiday gift for family, friends or even yourself.. This is a great place to look🤘🙏 https://www.seekdiscomfort.com"
4363,dbmrOy65cNw,Respect 👊
4364,dbmrOy65cNw,"In America especially, if you happened to be born Middle Eastern you are guilty and there's not even a proven till innocent scenario. America and our government uses the excuse that Middle Eastern people and Muslims have created some of the worst Terror attacks here, but really that's just the scapegoat to be blatantly racist and feel Justified and validated"
4365,dbmrOy65cNw,I seen them one night as a fluke when taking the dogs out at end of night. Didn't know what they were and thought at first end of world but then realised. They are beautiful ❤
4366,dbmrOy65cNw,❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
4367,dbmrOy65cNw,"Ah that alarm kills me every time. It’s the same one I have that wakes me up to go to work. If there’s one sound that instantly gets a reaction, it’s that one. If only the alarm were waking me up to go to the airport instead."
4368,dbmrOy65cNw,Well I guess if I ever wondered if dogs could poop while running this video answered that question for sure.. haha
4369,dbmrOy65cNw,"OH MAN, your video make me laugh, and cry in every episode! Thank you! All of these individuals you choose for these adventures are so deserving!"
4370,dbmrOy65cNw,That dog pooping is me chasing my dreams
4371,dbmrOy65cNw,You guys should do updates on people in former videos. Coming across this 3 years later and bet he's killing it!
4372,dbmrOy65cNw,لع\ن الله حكومة ال سلول العا£هر£ات عشاق الژ@ب
4373,dbmrOy65cNw,passport inequality really is so unfair. causing ordinary citizens to get caught up in the messiness of multilateral disagreements of governments. there should be a global trusted travelers program
4374,dbmrOy65cNw,is arab the same as muslim?
4375,dbmrOy65cNw,"Just recently got back from staying in Tromsø and seeing the Northern lights(before I even knew that Yes Theory existed)
This video obviously precedes that, but it still feels crazy and awesome to see Ammar and Matt in places that I remember walking."
4376,dbmrOy65cNw,8:44 Zayn Malik
4377,dbmrOy65cNw,What a beautiful person
4378,dbmrOy65cNw,"That would've taken some strength from Rida, language barrier, knowing no-one and being a young man with little other experiences... what a strong person, what a touching story and no doubt a very bright future ahead for Rida. 
This international discrimination has to stop, no one owns the planet and people from everywhere should be able to travel anywhere."
4379,dbmrOy65cNw,Minus 50 Celsius is when the sky is an organic fire show.  Green is baby lights…🤓
4380,dbmrOy65cNw,"I grew up in Northern Canada,  the northern lights can be like a rainbow on acid after dark.  It is epic to witness.  The colder weather, better views.🤘🏻🇨🇦"
4381,dbmrOy65cNw,How did you hooked that fish in the belly? 😂
4382,ODuEl4oNae0,"NEXT WEEK. BIGGEST SEEK DISCOMFORT DROP EVER. GET HYPED. Now to add a note on climate change, what's happening to Tuvalu is heartbreaking... We're trying really hard to work on our emissions. We're the first to admit that we're far from perfect and have a long way to go. We're educating ourselves on how we can be better and we carbon offset all our flights, which is a start but obviously not a final solution. We're actively experimenting with ways to improve and we'll be talking more about it in future videos! I'm feeling super grateful after this trip and I'm so excited I got to share this incredible experience with you all. Love -Thomas"
4383,ODuEl4oNae0,The I look at the bigger picture it seemed a bit lonely. Idk……
4384,ODuEl4oNae0,"I promise you my subscription is ""expensive"", I don't like to subscribe, I even hated some youtubers (especially from more advanced countries) because sometimes they are conceited. but man, you earned my respect. you came there with the eye of a child, not judging, nothing. I love that. So here's a thumbs up and I'll be sure to tune in to your other videos man!"
4385,ODuEl4oNae0,It's Nauru not Tuvalu!
4386,ODuEl4oNae0,"16:30 wow. how interesting that ""topa"" is ""farewell"" in tuvalu's language. i live on a caribbean island ""aruba"", also another tiny island but its closer to venezuela. our language is papiamento which is a creole language with influences of spanish, portuguese, dutch, afrikaans, etc. 

in papiamento ""ayo"" means ""bye"" but we also say ""topa"" as an expression for ""farewell"" or ""see you when i see you""! 

so cool. i've got to look more into tuvalu's language hahaha awesome vid btw"
4387,ODuEl4oNae0,I am from Pakistan. I just fell in love with this country.
4388,ODuEl4oNae0,It’s very amazing place 😊
4389,ODuEl4oNae0,An example of what heaven will be like.
4390,ODuEl4oNae0,"This video felt so empty... I mean, so many questions that you did not bother to ask or find out... Where do they find potable water? How do they generate electricity? What do people make for a living? Do they grow crops? Do they rise chickens?  So many questions... What a shame. It could have been a really great video..."
4391,ODuEl4oNae0,This has to be one of the most beautiful islands in the world
4392,ODuEl4oNae0,Damn what a beautiful place
4393,ODuEl4oNae0,Loved this video…..🎉❤
4394,ODuEl4oNae0,"It is pristine and all but I do not think the title was appropriate. 



I believe North Korea would be that least visited country but hey, maybe the least visited democratic country?"
4395,ODuEl4oNae0,"Every now and then I come back to this video. Watched it over 20 times. Literally love it, gives you a very good mood"
4396,ODuEl4oNae0,"Amazing, I'm from nz and I'm delighted to see you visited Tuvalu. Suprised I saw my aunt in your videos, never been to tuvalu, but now I want to go...."
4397,ODuEl4oNae0,What a beautiful remote place. This is paradise. Love from Indonesia.
4398,ODuEl4oNae0,I wish I can go here.
4399,ODuEl4oNae0,"oh yes....blame it on climate change.....if thats what you think, what are YOU going to do about it?    I don't see anything in your videos to indicate you do anything....what a joke you are"
4400,ODuEl4oNae0,Did you go back?
4401,ODuEl4oNae0,Hold on a second …. The guy went alone??   That some friends  u got there
4402,uSd_tZ3gMWc,"First. Also, make sure to subscribe y'all!!"
4403,uSd_tZ3gMWc,"I would like to thank you for coming to our small community to do this, although I was only a freshman in highschool and didn’t get to attend I heard a lot of stories and this town is amazing! James was actually my boss for 3 years and everyone in this video is someone who I am close with him some form! I only lived there throughout my highschool years and everyone was more than welcoming and I became a big influence in the short time i was there."
4404,uSd_tZ3gMWc,I hope to hear more about Mankato now December 2023. How is the town? More visitors? I Enjoyed this video.
4405,uSd_tZ3gMWc,Amarr it's cause Tomas was talking duh
4406,uSd_tZ3gMWc,Amarr is dropping a bomb
4407,uSd_tZ3gMWc,Sorry i left my flannel in the past 😂
4408,uSd_tZ3gMWc,id prefer to live in peace and tranquility like this town
4409,uSd_tZ3gMWc,3:47 why he grabbing he ahh
4410,uSd_tZ3gMWc,I ❤ this energy 😊
4411,uSd_tZ3gMWc,Hello Yes Theory Fam. I just realize that i've been watching knowing i still haven't subscribe! i'm so sorry. but thanks for reminding me thomas! HAHAHA
4412,uSd_tZ3gMWc,"The fact that these guys were in SALINA and I had no idea who they were at the time blows my mind. I live in Kansas and have traveled to Salina more than a few times to see family and friends. Knowing the Yes Theory guys were even in my state, let alone within 100 miles of me, is amazing to me.

This channel has inspired me to travel and make connections I never would have otherwise, and seeing that they were actually relatively close to me at one point, just makes me this more impactful to me. That even someone like me, living in rural Kansas, can be that close to people who embody the very essence of travel and the good of humanity. It shows me that this feeling of love and connection can come from anyone. Big or small."
4413,uSd_tZ3gMWc,"11:20 for those of you who don't believe in freemasonry, look at the middle of this frame (building with blue and white) and you can see their logo beside the grey car. If you search up freemason logo, it matches. Do some research guy!"
4414,uSd_tZ3gMWc,"Wow, Conor looking like a young Robert Redford in that cowboy hat. 🤠"
4415,uSd_tZ3gMWc,I don't think he realizes he looks like your average Caucasian american. He doesn't look Arab and no one would ever know he's Muslim unless he talked about it😂
4416,uSd_tZ3gMWc,"You should come to my town. I live in Los Molinos california. Has maybe 3,000 people call Mom the majority are elderly to geriatric call Mom incredibly conservative to sickly levels, stupidly religious. There are so many churches yet there's barely anyone who lives here because the cult mindset is real! Especially when you're poor and white and no one who is in charge of this town seems to think that the town needs anything more than what it has which is a couple of restaurants, post office, like five freaking gas stations for some reason, and a couple of other shops that no one is ever at"
4417,uSd_tZ3gMWc,"I know this might sound really boring, but maybe do one on Rlrural California. Most people don't seem to realize that almost all of California is rural, and also conservative. Even people born and raised here, don't seem to realize this! The parts that are liberal and have nice climates are the coastal communities, which are very few in California and most people who live in California and not in California don't seem to comprehend this and think all of California is liberal, but only tiny little condensed pockets are liberal and educated. The rest is just like the majority of the country, uncultured, ignorant, and toxic levels of religious"
4418,uSd_tZ3gMWc,I love watch your videos and seeing your wild idea’s come to reality… #SeekDiscomfort
4419,uSd_tZ3gMWc,You went through HAYS? Y’all missed out!

4432,z8lo8pytum4,I want to be able to start my own consultation busy for the city it state for irrigation. My dad owed to biggest landscape construction business in California and had to sell it when I was planning music in Oregon. I want to be able to show my family that it was never a bad choice.

4436,z8lo8pytum4, You're always making me cry
4437,z8lo8pytum4,"Does anyone else see the gong has ""WUHAN"" written on it? And this video was uploaded right before the pandemic? Can't believe YesTheory started covid19...."
4438,z8lo8pytum4,I wish I could like this and all the videos million times... You guys have in a way given me hope... Thank you.. Thank you.. A million times thank you❤️✌️🍻

4452,ASXbV9Tb1pY,"Omg, ammar attending school in South Africa"
4453,ASXbV9Tb1pY,"15:11 all good but this bathroom is impossible to clean. Every time you flush the toilet, it gets a bit dirtier around it"
4454,ASXbV9Tb1pY,😀😀
4455,ASXbV9Tb1pY,My only ques to Armaan...Is this whole project a sustainable one?
4456,ASXbV9Tb1pY,Crazy to think this was 2 years ago. I love rewatching the old videos! Yes theory has definitely evolved over the years and it’s all been really amazing to watch.
4457,ASXbV9Tb1pY,"Hey yes theory Hopefully you could come to Philippines and together let’s seek discomfort here, cause I’m very comfortable being myself and wanted to be alone or with my gf just me and her, but I want that to change and all your videos inspired me but I can’t do anything so let’s seek discomfort here in the Philippines and help me change.

4458,ASXbV9Tb1pY,its so coooooooooooooooool
4459,ASXbV9Tb1pY,i binge-watching all the yes theory videos :)
4460,ASXbV9Tb1pY,It is so sad that everybody will help you guys build a free while so many people are literally homeless with nojob it is also sad how fast you get passports while the rest of us can't get one at all
4461,ASXbV9Tb1pY,no idea Ammar studied in SA! :O
4462,zVudr8cxHRE,THAT... Was insanity. But also surprisingly wholesome at the end... Check out Zac and Jay for their version of the experience and don't miss miss our Seek Discomfort x Lululemon Collab!! https://www.seekdiscomfort.com/ Much love everyone - Matt <3
4463,zVudr8cxHRE,It looks like an interesting journey and a  trip i wish i could do
4464,zVudr8cxHRE,"that was a loooong loong journey haha...😂 i thought i got the longest travel because from dubai airport to manila ( philippine airport) is a 9 hours flight then another two hours drive going to bus terminal and 9-10 hours on a bus with a lot of zigzaggy roads of northern roads of the philippines, and another 30 mins ride in the van going to my hometown and 5 mins ride to a motorcycle... 😂"
4465,zVudr8cxHRE,Do Russia
4466,zVudr8cxHRE,Hmmmm… I went on tour with a drum corp for 3 months straight for 5 years. We slept on a bus and in high school gyms on air mattress out of our suitcases and practiced at least 8 hours a day.
4467,zVudr8cxHRE,Jesus sis coming back. Believe He died for your sins and rose again then repent to be saved.
4468,zVudr8cxHRE,"o the ""iron man"" wants to go homeeeeee and cut the footage on his own channel, weakkkkkk"
4469,zVudr8cxHRE,does that horrible bus service compesate you guys for any of the delays and mixups  DANG
4470,zVudr8cxHRE,if it helps you feel better i was on a plane once and before take off some big guy farted and it smelled so bad they had to delay the plane and open the door to recapture fresh air before started a new take off... it was horrible
4471,zVudr8cxHRE,so glad that's you guys and not me...  well done  at least you had each other
4472,zVudr8cxHRE,"i am an Enlgish teacher in China and last semester our book showed a bus ride from washington D.C. to Antartica... I am from Jacksonville Florida and didn't know you could take a bus there... or i would have done it or drove it...  the leg of the trip is of course by boat but there is a guy who did it and we covered the story from our text books...The article is called bus to antartica  sponsored by the National Geographic Society  Andrew Evens traveled 10,000 miles on 40 buses through 9 states and 17 countries"
4473,zVudr8cxHRE,The people you will meet on a Greyhound is amazing.  It is like a box of chocolates.
4474,zVudr8cxHRE,To rus-
4475,zVudr8cxHRE,Not even on the bus 1/4 through the vid quit jerking yourself off and show the only interesting bit.
4476,zVudr8cxHRE,Not sure what was longer your 84 hr bus ride or the advert at the start of your post.
4477,zVudr8cxHRE,"I once did a bus from Detroit to Birmingham Alabama when I was 18 for a total of 18 hours. That was brutal, I can't even imagine 84 hours"
4478,zVudr8cxHRE,"I just wanted to share, back in 2017 I rode alone from Fayetteville, NC then it took me to orlando before heading to the west coast and up to Tacoma, WA where I’m still currently living. It was also hurricane season and I got stuck in Huston, TX for almost 24 hours being told our bus was canceled because of hurricane Harvey and we were told we had to figure out a safe place to stay for ourselves. Luckily, they had a few bus drivers that came through and got everyone out only a few hours before Houston completely flooded. I was also moving from NC, to WA with as many of my belongings as possible in three bags and my trusty service Australian shepherd Callie. It was hell, but it could’ve been worse. A three day trip turned into almost five days, I was 21 and my Aussie was 14 months, and I never once used the bathroom on the bus💪🏼"
4479,zVudr8cxHRE,But u guys had fun 😅
4480,zVudr8cxHRE,I did this alone when I was 19 leaving bording school. Took 2.5 days and extremely sucked.
4481,zVudr8cxHRE,Did you guys ever accept Zac’s challenge???!!! 😂
4482,Y6A8wBRoUXE,"Hey everyone, this is Thomas, I just want to say that the morning I walked out with TD to meet Staffan was so strange. I've been a skeptical of ""energy"" and how much influence manifesting something can have. But that morning, I decided to approach looking for a stranger differently. I took my time. I wanted to create the most optimal headspace for myself. I went for a run, meditated, felt grateful about the opportunities we have and everyone around us and decided that I was going to walk out the door and change someone's life. Changing someone's life might sound hyperbolic to some of you, but I knew that whatever would happen that day, it would forever alter their perception of the world. Then TD landed that morning and arrived with equally good vibes. But we weren't in a rush. We didn't stress about ""finding someone"" for the episode, or just filming for the sake of filming. Instead, we went for coffee to catch up before going out, we took our time prepping the gear and making sure we were both in the right headspace. We made a dozen small decisions that morning that pushed us back by 5 minutes each time, then walked out and immediately met Staffan. You might call this luck. But for me, this just showed how our perspective, intention and the energy we bring to everything we do is important beyond measure. You just can't fake it. It's real and fires inside of you. TD was for the longest time one of the most skeptical people I've ever met but through experiences like this, he now fully believes anything is possible. Believing and positive energy can truly go a long way. Much love"
4483,Y6A8wBRoUXE,Steffan is literally amazing love that dude
4484,Y6A8wBRoUXE,"I started bingeing yestheory yesterday. I cried through ammar’s journey, now im crying seeing staffan’s. The heart that goes into each video as a result of each action is just heartwarming."
4485,Y6A8wBRoUXE,definitely stefan's biggest yes in his life🎉
4486,Y6A8wBRoUXE,Back here in 2023 to watch Staffan’s origin story
4487,Y6A8wBRoUXE,"Amazing to me how so many people use work for a reason to say no to this. It’s 3 days. Who can’t take off 3 days from work, even if you have to lie and play sick?"
4488,Y6A8wBRoUXE,Little did he know 😂
4489,Y6A8wBRoUXE,Have you ever visited Nigeria? I am from Nigeria and I will like to see @Yes theory crew in my country.
4490,Y6A8wBRoUXE,It's surreal watching this in 2023 seeing how this radically changed Staffan's life. It almost feels like a bit where they're introducing a guy they just hired.
4491,Y6A8wBRoUXE,Love watching this and seeing where Staffan is now
4492,Y6A8wBRoUXE,Best video on YouTube?
4493,Y6A8wBRoUXE,"Staffan, I know you'll probably never read this, and I'll probably never meet you, but watching the guys meet you in this video for the first time and seeing where you are today is absolutely amazing. We are so proud of you and we all love you now being a full time member of the YesTheory team. I hope the future is nothing but good for you. Lots of love x"
4494,Y6A8wBRoUXE,Fort st john bc Canada 🇨🇦
4495,Y6A8wBRoUXE,"Your dream life is literally one day away, one person away and one choice away. This video gives me chills"
4496,Y6A8wBRoUXE,Rewatching this for probably the 10th time lol... Staffans podcast episode brought me back 🙏 What a happy ending!
4497,Y6A8wBRoUXE,It's so weird to watch this again xD it's crazy how Stefan ended up part of Yes Theory. He is such a perfect fit and is crazy to think that he could've said No and today thing would look so different.
4498,Y6A8wBRoUXE,"3:16 
The moment thomas realized Stefan was the one"
4499,Y6A8wBRoUXE,"2:15
Amazing watching this after seeing all the adventures these two have gone on since! The way things played out after that simple greeting is incredible"
4500,Y6A8wBRoUXE,❤
4501,Y6A8wBRoUXE,love yes theory. Stephan is awesome.
4502,CWwAMfuOdZ8,this is yes theory or No theory man cant beleive you did not make the night!!!!!   welll still cant stop watching your video!! peace!
4503,CWwAMfuOdZ8,"Seeking discomfort is one thing, but just being stupid and doing something that could risk your life for absolutely no reason is just asinine"
4504,CWwAMfuOdZ8,Are they trying to say Mo-hov-vee?
4505,CWwAMfuOdZ8,What do you do if you need the toilet.........
4506,CWwAMfuOdZ8,Mate i was freaking out for you all near that edge. Proud of you all and thanks for sharing the experience❤
4507,CWwAMfuOdZ8,This episode gave Me serious anxiety.
4508,CWwAMfuOdZ8,Feel like this is all the drama I need in my life.how can we meet and explore the yes theory together
4509,CWwAMfuOdZ8,15:10 bruhhh
4510,CWwAMfuOdZ8,W
4511,CWwAMfuOdZ8,This looks so fun
4512,CWwAMfuOdZ8,I am almost heart attack now🥹🥹 you all are so amazing! Seriously!🥹
4513,CWwAMfuOdZ8,I can only assume Thomas had just a slight fear of heights. For me it's so present that i couldn't even watch the video without feeling vertigo and nausiated (even had to pause a few times). no level of commitment would ever drive me to do something like this. ever.
4514,CWwAMfuOdZ8,Love the question at the beginning really gave a great chance to just think and made me think of so many amazing memories
4515,CWwAMfuOdZ8,"I thought it was called tightrope walking? or is that different? cause even high up far ones always been called tightrope walking, at least here in the states in the Midwest"
4516,CWwAMfuOdZ8,"I actually stopped the video 1 minute and 9 seconds in, so I could write this comment! ... I hope someone @YesTheory actually reads it, but it's okay if they don't! xD It is three years after the fact. lol Anyroad, I'm semi-new to the YesTheory channel, and  have been kinda binge-watching the recent stuff and selectively poking around and watching the older stuff and I feel like the opening to this video, talking about fear like a muscle in the brain (not exactly how it is but didn't matter!) and the healthiest thing you can do is to keep exploring relatively safe ways to experience those things you're most afraid of, so you can retrain your brain and I think it's the best I've seen and heard it put together yet! <3 Fear is the emotional embodiment of distrust, so what you guys are doing, is retraining your minds and bodies to trust! Trust in yourself (your abilities, your thought processes, your emotional reactions, your instincts and intuitions) as well as those around you! Other-selves! Their bodies, their minds, their thoughts, their emotional reactions, their instincts and intuitions! Trust in the equipment, the earth, the water, the animals, the plants, the universal forces both known and unknown! I sincerely thank you and will surely be adding YesTheory to my personal list of acknowledgements for great inspirations in my life! Your whole team is amazing! <3 ~Remmy"
4517,CWwAMfuOdZ8,"Is it just me or is this more terrifying than skydiving? With skydiving, my brain doesn't seem to comprehend it, so I'm less scared. But a cliff... my brain comprehends that VERY well."
4518,CWwAMfuOdZ8,Thomas you did great i would have not made it that far   you're lucky it was dark when you went over and couldn't see where you are
4519,CWwAMfuOdZ8,NO WAY
4520,CWwAMfuOdZ8,I like yellow shirt guy.. he’s a problem solver and a go getter with a solid attitude what more could you ask for
4521,CWwAMfuOdZ8,The guy is too fucking gay. This is where real men are distinguished.
4522,-mt8aNy1M00,"It took 7 days in the jungle of Guatemala, 8 weeks of editing with a whole team of editors and a community supporting us by purchasing the doc early to make this happen... (And then YouTube doesn't let us monetize it hah, great!). No but we feel so grateful for this wild adventure and couldn't be happier we finally uploaded this to YouTube. The amount of endless software problems, challenges in the story and brainstorms on how we could continue making films like this in the future has been wild. We're stoked to be in a place where we're happy to put this out for all of you guys to see. Thank you so all the creators for joining us and helping make this film possible. Thank you so Sam Kolder, Andreas Hem, Sorelle Amore, Johnny FPV, Chelsea Yamase, Max Rantz MacDonald and Perry Grone. There are links in the description for biosphere preservation, we highly encourage you to check it out and support in whatever capacity you can. MUCH LOVE!"

4524,-mt8aNy1M00,YASSSS MONTREAL.
4525,-mt8aNy1M00,"Is it me or do these guys think because they have a dream a whole government should just fall on their knees and grant it to them? like nobody is allowed to climb the pyramids in Egypt, why would they think it was gonna happen so easily or that the world is against them? like that's a treasure of humanity... people just don't go climbing on it just because they want to hahhahah"
4526,-mt8aNy1M00,You guys' videos are absolutely incredible. Thank you for changing peoples lives and showing the world how incredible life can be if you follow your heart and seek discomfort!
4527,-mt8aNy1M00,Sometimes I wonder how many histories we've lost and there are billions of stories that we will never know!
4528,-mt8aNy1M00,That emo editing was painful
4529,-mt8aNy1M00,❤❤❤
4530,-mt8aNy1M00,"Yes, how hiking this jungle when I was in Guatemala. It's quite common for tourists. these guys are overdramatizing the situation like they're risking their lives. but yes, there is really good. I love their documentaries but I think this one's little excessive on dramatization."
4531,-mt8aNy1M00,21:43 what a shot!!!
4532,-mt8aNy1M00,I hope and pray Ammar's father apologized to him eventually!! I never knew mine until almost 20. It has to be even harder if you grew up with him.  Then having him speak like that to you. Meanwhile wanting to continue on your path searching to accomplish your dreams and not wanting to let him and entire family down.! 😢 Blessings to you all. 😊
4533,-mt8aNy1M00,"Thanks Omar for saying all that! I am myself on a similar journey! I'm doing something different, your message just reignited something, just like that!"
4534,-mt8aNy1M00,Nobody gonna talk about how aliens were showed to be tiny from Mexico and that pyramid has tiny hallways
4535,-mt8aNy1M00,"As a Guatemalan, this makes me proud to see how beautiful the country really is."
4536,-mt8aNy1M00,WOW UR ALL AWESOME GUYZ. CONGRATS
4537,-mt8aNy1M00,"Wait... so you met Ammar's family in 2017, but dad sent the text in 2019 saying you guys are perverted? That's messed up big time."

4542,7mz4ikBUMTM,"Yep, I withdrew all of my 401k after being in trouble with the wrong people thinking I needed to quit my job and move.  Went on a vacation with my ex-wife to try and move, turns out she was the gangster doing stuff.  I’m seeking restitution for the 70k which should never have been withdrawn, and wouldn’t have had anyone been upfront about what was happening.  Also lost wages during this time.  Finally our house was valued at 280,000 to 330,000.  I ended up with a check for 45,000 which is less than the original down payment.  It’s $500,000.  I can’t tell you who’s responsibility it is to pay that and I’m not taking them to court, but it will be fun watching them scramble to pass the buck."
4543,7mz4ikBUMTM,❤
4544,7mz4ikBUMTM,"Got damm it, this is the first time i see this video"

4551,7mz4ikBUMTM,"Hey yes fam 
I am watching the videos for around three years now and love the ideas,
 but i have a little problem, i am from a little town in the middle of germany close to
the Harz mountains called Quedlinburg. I always wanted to find
someone that is also watches Yes Theory but i have never found anyone
close to me. I also tried to ask in several german communities but i
never had luck so if anyone who is from quedlinburg might read this
(eventough it is highly unlikely) i would love to get to know u
because i just feel so far away from this when i watch those videos.

u can answer on this comment or send me
a direct message to my youtube account. 

For everyone else have a awesome day
and always seek discomfort"

On the app my response for one dating app prompt, ""Best first date: Terminal 2, any gate"" (SAN airport's terminal for most international flights 😄).  I suppose that since I've travelled abroad solo many times, a first date trip is similar to travel among strangers for me. 

Btw, I loooove Ocean & Kayleigh (@mermaid.kayleigh). They're such advocates for sharks!"

4644,u0eGSi7AUCI,Typical lads mocking each other 😁  am waiting for it ....the shit to hit the fan  🤪
4645,u0eGSi7AUCI,"Ammar, I feel you bro. whahahha… I have sea sickness too. That’s not an easy task. goshhh"
4646,u0eGSi7AUCI,Try surviving at sea for 428 days.. . That actually happened once.
4647,u0eGSi7AUCI,How did you go to the bathroom?
4648,u0eGSi7AUCI,I want to to experience this but I want to be alone and just get lost
4649,u0eGSi7AUCI,did anyone have to poop or pee?  that would be gross
4650,u0eGSi7AUCI,DANG now that is SEEKING DISCOMFORT   OMG

4652,u0eGSi7AUCI,11:43 - It was so funny when he got jump scared lol.
4653,u0eGSi7AUCI,Anyone with motion sickness get some bonine tablets. Very very good and non-drowsy. Or get Dramamine for a sleepy version of it.
4654,u0eGSi7AUCI,Where are we??.....scans....keep scanning..hold on! Cut! Don't get the shore line

4657,u0eGSi7AUCI,do a week
4658,u0eGSi7AUCI,"Watching with a bottle of Coke

4659,u0eGSi7AUCI,Actually candy is for sickness
4660,u0eGSi7AUCI,that was not an adventure totally glass like water.  try it with some waves and swells😜
4661,u0eGSi7AUCI,"A technique I learned from my friends when we free dive especially during night time to avoid seasickness when you're floating on a raft is to cover your head not just with a hoodie but with a towel, including your ears. aside from bringing anti-seasickness pills, you also have to bring something of a mint or menthol liniment (I'm filipina btw) to bring cold to the muscles especially on the sides of your head whenever you feel dizzy.

this comment is dedicated to ammar, I hope you enjoy the ocean someday🤙🤙"
4662,BYCETjh4eMc,"True story - I once lived in a Airport for 10 days because I had no money to pay rent. Airport fulfilled my basic needs of a roof, toilet, a place to sleep."
4663,BYCETjh4eMc,"Incredible video! I spent 20 hours in Calgary airport and the vibe was kind of the same because I thought it wasn't allowed and I never stayed that long in an airport ever. Felt crazy but nothing compared to 72. But I was in the canada zone, not the international neutral zone."
4664,BYCETjh4eMc,"The part where you're checked by airport security is just random. We were sleeping here now waiting for our flight and we were also approached by them. Lols. So yep, they didn't really noticed your presence that time you did the vlog. Mission accomplished. Hahaha!"
4665,BYCETjh4eMc,even though i’m 4 years late still happy my country is being recognised :D
4666,BYCETjh4eMc,"Hahahaha “we don’t know if we’re breaking any rules” 😂
But ignorance is not considered self defense for prosecution"
4667,BYCETjh4eMc,Welcome to Singapore and please come back again real soon.
4668,BYCETjh4eMc,Super irresponsible of them to post this and celebrating doing something that is technically an offence. I hope they are barred from the country.
4669,BYCETjh4eMc,anyone else going to be homeless and watching this just in case you have to live at an airport because cost of living is getting screwed?
4670,BYCETjh4eMc,it's ok when white people do it
4671,BYCETjh4eMc,white privilege duh
4672,BYCETjh4eMc,"Holy crap. This airport is like a resort. A pool, a spa, a movie theater?! Crazy. Oh and a Louis Vuitton. Probably has more crazy stores I didn’t see"
4673,BYCETjh4eMc,So why dont you chwck in for 2 days then he checks in for 2 days. Boom. Provoem solved
4674,BYCETjh4eMc,"after these guys done this in changi, Police in Changi seem to enhanced check."
4675,BYCETjh4eMc,"impressive, try Philippine airport the worst airport LOL"
4676,BYCETjh4eMc,"Seeing ""arrestable offence"" and going through with it anyways is crazy hilarious."
4677,BYCETjh4eMc,I spent the night in the airport one time I hated it. 😑
4678,BYCETjh4eMc,"I lived in the Denver airport for about six months while I was homeless. Nowhere near the amount of amenities the airport you all stayed in, but it was fairly nice. I didn't have much money though, so I usually had to make a Subway sandwich last a couple days"
4679,BYCETjh4eMc,They most certainly noticed but didn’t say anything because they didn’t think you were causing a problem or threat so they left you alone
4680,BYCETjh4eMc,IM ACTUALLY IN CHANGI ATM!! 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
4681,BYCETjh4eMc,"Me and my brother had a 10 hour stopover in Singapore. We went to immigration and asked if we could go into town. No problem, and they gave us a 3-day stamp. Me and my bro got the bus into town and found a nice bar to spend some time in. 
There was also a bus tour( few years ago), for passengers with a boarding pass, to see Singapore, but we did'nt want that because you cannot leave the coach. 
So, next time you have a long stopover at an airport, go see immigration about 'exploring' outside the airport?"
4682,kOZnpwI2hIM,"Truly living the dream, I can only dream to travel the way you guys do. Amazing content been binging for a week now and can’t get enough, thank you!"
4683,kOZnpwI2hIM,You made me cry Luke. God Bless everyone.

4685,kOZnpwI2hIM,What a pick that was
4686,kOZnpwI2hIM,"No shit, great video, i live in Cairns and drive boats. Hope you had a great time."
4687,kOZnpwI2hIM,I hope you take Luke to another adventure.
4688,kOZnpwI2hIM,I would love to see a video where y'all go to the federate states of micronesia
4689,kOZnpwI2hIM,"Everyone you met must have story, in every single video. This make your channel the realest channel."
4690,kOZnpwI2hIM,❤ Amazing video ❤
4691,kOZnpwI2hIM,I think this is my favorite youtube video of all time
4692,kOZnpwI2hIM,i'm probably very late to see this video but hands down this is the one of the best video i ever seen in youtube🥺🥺❤❤
4693,kOZnpwI2hIM,"I from  Lithuania, I always wanted to visit New Caledonia"
4694,kOZnpwI2hIM,Matt don’t leave Yes Theory Fam. goshhh… I hope you can go back what you used to which is travelling around the World with the Yes Fam.
4695,kOZnpwI2hIM,This time come to Perth Aus
4696,kOZnpwI2hIM,love from India
4697,kOZnpwI2hIM,"throw a rock and you will hit a fascinating, open hearted person with a story to share and an adventure to accompany you on. life really is an infinite room of doors waiting to be knocked on. 

but don’t actually throw rocks at people"
4698,kOZnpwI2hIM,R.I.P Luke 😢
4699,kOZnpwI2hIM,This video encouraged me to be more spontaneous. Immediately after watching this I texted my friend ''let's book a flight''. He gave me his yes and then we also let the globe decide where our destination is. Flying to Scotland in a few months then!!!
4700,kOZnpwI2hIM,"as an Australian I can confirm that this is not faked this is every Australian, it's not a stereotype"
4701,kOZnpwI2hIM,🙏 Luke❤
4702,WtJxVrr2F8M,"We Filipinos love Koreans. Happy to watch this. 
Filipinos are fan of Kpop that’s why a lot of Filipinos love to travel in Korea. 

That Korean is so kind and hospitable. God send people in our life to help us if we needed help."
4703,WtJxVrr2F8M,Canadians for the win 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦
4704,WtJxVrr2F8M,I hope your team returns to South Korea soon!
4705,WtJxVrr2F8M,How is someone so screwed up in the head as to twist you filming and asking for help as politically offensive?? I'm so confused
4706,WtJxVrr2F8M,This dude literally spent money by taking the bus in like the first five minutes...
4707,WtJxVrr2F8M,try this in finland
4708,WtJxVrr2F8M,You did not specify which Korea 🧐
4709,WtJxVrr2F8M,"this just show there is still hope for humanity, love your guys videos keep up the good work stay healthy"
4710,WtJxVrr2F8M,"disgusting begpacker
Begging on a tourist visa is illegal. like a parasite"
4711,WtJxVrr2F8M,I love how they all actually spent the 24 hours for this challenge instead of going overnight.
4712,WtJxVrr2F8M,If it were a girl it would be totally different. A girl would never let anyone sleep in their house even if the other person is of the same gender
4713,WtJxVrr2F8M,Hojun is on my list of heros now. Normal people who are example by their simple life. What a guy! So much kindness to teach the world. My goodness. I'd love to meet him!
4714,WtJxVrr2F8M,This doesnt make sense because koreans kinda look up to Americans so everyone learns english like almost as basics like math and science so most of the people in the country actually do speak english. One of the smartest nations in the world this challenge TOO EX
4715,WtJxVrr2F8M,"Please visit Armenia🙏🏻it’s is such an amazing place, you will love it!"
4716,WtJxVrr2F8M,You shoulda went to the show omgg
4717,WtJxVrr2F8M,You should have went to Hongdae or Itaewon. Tons of Americans and foreigners there. More people could have helped you.
4718,WtJxVrr2F8M,"This video is soo beautiful!! It made me so nostalgic for Korea, as I lived in the countryside there a few years back. South Koreans are incredibly nice, but it usually takes you - the foreigner - to open up to them first before they truly show their wild side haha! 😂 Thank you for showing such an amazing pov of Seoul, I hope you get the chance to visit again soon! 호준이는 방금 마트에서 돌아온 것처럼 서울 우유 한 상자를 들고 있다가 갑자기 이 낯선 외국인을 집으로 초대했어요... 그 똥은 나에게 너무 재미있었다!! 😭🤡"
4719,WtJxVrr2F8M,They should do this in the Philippines I think it will be entertaining
4720,WtJxVrr2F8M,Shitty contents. Having money to come to Korea but begging on the streets? Don do this. And you are juicing money by filming all this. Ridiculous. Koreans are kind but dont take it for granted
4721,WtJxVrr2F8M,❤❤
4722,SKuhvTGiXz4,"Text ""I'm in"" to 323-310-5420 to get updates from Ammar and Matt on #100daysofsweat"
4723,SKuhvTGiXz4,I did this last January and lost 30 pounds. 6 months later I think it's time to do it again! Let's do this.
4724,SKuhvTGiXz4,It may change your life for the better 😌
4725,SKuhvTGiXz4,Love this
4726,SKuhvTGiXz4,"I've been walking and biking since 2009, I've reached many goals and each year brings new challenges, I don't run because hurts my knees but the actives keep me moving! last year along 2021, I achieved 2,305.42 miles!! 🚲🚶🏼‍♀I can't wait to see what I get this year!! Let's GO!!"
4727,SKuhvTGiXz4,"So it's my day 100 today. Hit a really low point in my life this year and got really depressed, lost hope in everything and stopped enjoying the things I used to love, then as I was sitting in my bed trying to find something to distract myself I stumbled upon this channel. It re-ignited my passion and so I decided to delete social media for 30 days to completely push for my dream. I remember scrolling through the videos on the channel and finding this exact video, waking up at 5:30 am the next morning unable to sleep, and saying f*ck it. I started working out, completed 50, Push Ups 50 Sit ups, 50 Squats, and a 30 second plank. I ended up throwing up, but I also felt really exhilarated, I entered a flow state that allowed me to forget all things that were going on, I could only focus on how far I could go. I think the best part of all of this isn't the actual achievement of the goal, it was the journey. And so I decided to make my first video centered around that journey, My Journey To 100, I hope to inspire more individuals to start working out, start finding people they can work out with, to allow them to see for themselves that even when they are depressed there is still a way out of that dark abyss, a light at the end of that tunnel. Thx Yes Theory for pulling me out of that dark abyss, I don't know if you'll ever see this, I mean the last comment was 2 years ago. But you know what I hope you see this, I hope that one day when I finally become an influencer that I can look back on this message, remembering that it isn't impossible to make a change in your life, all it takes is a shift in your perspective! 

ALL THE LOVE <3

- A.I.M"

4742,tG678spaEm0,"Rewatching this after I just finished reading the book and stopped crying. always stay happy, Matt, no matter where life will take you now ♥️ Thank you for everything."

4753,tG678spaEm0,"i cant ever be part of the Yes Theory, because i say yes to everything and never quit on a challenge."
4754,tG678spaEm0,Gave me the chills! Currently dipping my toes in sprint triathlon. Hope to do an Ironman one day!
4755,tG678spaEm0,"2 years later still getting constant chills. Sometimes i go back to these videos, when life gets hard, and motivation is at its final last break. But then you overcome that with you guys just killing it and inspiring all of us to do better fuck i love you guys"
4756,tG678spaEm0,I come back to this video the day before every race. Nothing gets me motivated like this!
4757,tG678spaEm0,"As a triathlete, I am so happy to see people going out there and pushing themselves to the limit
 to do something that many people find crazy, I love to see it all!"
4758,tG678spaEm0,One year later. I‘m currently on my way to participate in my first half Ironman and came back for motivation. I love it. Thank you very much for inspiring me! I’m going to give it my all!
4759,tG678spaEm0,jew
4760,tG678spaEm0,This is one of the best Yes Theory videos for me
4761,tG678spaEm0,Almost a year ago (Last August) this video inspired me to buy my first road bike and start training. And now I’m sitting on the edge of my bed at an Air BnB preparing to do Ironman Lake Placid tomorrow. I love you all so much. ❤️
4762,F2OhCCEIOcU,I watched 20 min in full of tears. I can't believe how Ammar stays so pure hearted in this world
4763,F2OhCCEIOcU,"I don't know a single adult who has this many friends at the same time. Maybe throughout their entire life they've had this many friends, but not all at once! It's virtually unheard of"
4764,F2OhCCEIOcU,To have friends…❤
4765,F2OhCCEIOcU,"Omg this touched my heart and soul on many levels! All I can say is that I truly love all of you! I needed to see this today for so many reasons. I’m dealing with so many things these days from physical, emotional, and spiritual pain that runs deep. I see miracles all around & I feel so blessed that pick up on the truly beautiful power of love. Thanks for sharing this 🫶🏽
I have a piece of glimmer & hope… May God bless continue to bless you all in life!! What y’all do really matters."
4766,F2OhCCEIOcU,"Oh my god, I had to cry at the end, that was sooooo whoooolesome, wow!

4770,F2OhCCEIOcU,Happy Birthday Ammar❤
4771,F2OhCCEIOcU,best video i've seen so far this year
4772,F2OhCCEIOcU,"Hi Guys, I am in the UK and I want to buy hoodie (rose design) which is Matt is wearing in this chapter. Can I buy it? I looked the website but could not find it. Thanks."
4773,F2OhCCEIOcU,❤️❤️❤️
4774,F2OhCCEIOcU,"saying yes.  so simple yet so brilliant.  it seems the most amazing ideas are always the simplest.  well done.  love these.  if i ever run into you, i am going to act like i have no clue who you are so i can go on the adventure. hahaha"
4775,F2OhCCEIOcU,"Me: Turning 25 and have nowhere near the level of experience or half the character Ammar, and the rest of Yes Theory, has. I know I'm 3 years late, but thank you for all of the happy cry's you provide for me in my most depressing times. Thank you <3"
4776,F2OhCCEIOcU,"Wow guys what a video…I have no words except THANK YOU. This video really touched me, obrigada 🫶"

4778,F2OhCCEIOcU,"Can someone please tell me the name of the song that starts @ 7:00.  And where I can find it?

Thanks in advance :)"
4779,F2OhCCEIOcU,I'm speechless at the intensity that Ammar and the Yes Theory team live. This video made me truly see the meaning of 'Live each day as if it was your last'. And it's forcing me to look at my own life with brutal honesty and ask myself: Am I living it to the fullest?...
4780,F2OhCCEIOcU,I cried so hard.. wow ❤️ Thank you guys for filling the world with all your love❤️
4781,F2OhCCEIOcU,❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤

4785,PWLobZEIZG8,India is not a harsh place at all
4786,PWLobZEIZG8,"I often wonder why the fuck foreigners always come to Mumbai or Delhi if not those 2 cities they would go to Rajasthan 
fucking go to Himalayas maybe to North East or to South of India or to an Islands like Andaman instead 
Yes theory is great I know u guys will come here again to do something epic."
4787,PWLobZEIZG8,"i am the harsh her girl friend was talking about, lol, india is my place..."
4788,PWLobZEIZG8,THIS is AWESOME! So great😊
4789,PWLobZEIZG8,When you go back to Bharat PLEASE go visit the Isha Yoga Center in Coimbatore and listen to a darshan from Sadhguru. It will absolutely change your life! You guys would LOVE Inner Engineering! We offer it as a 4 day in person class in Los Angeles or online at your own pace! Please consider looking it up and giving it a try 🙏😃
4790,PWLobZEIZG8,No place in the world is as diverse and throbbing with energy as India
4791,PWLobZEIZG8,The girl is soooo pretty
4792,PWLobZEIZG8,"Thomas you literally don't know how much time I have ever watched this video!! This is one of my most Favorite movie not because it's from India and I'm an Indian the closing dialogues you said. You conquer your fear it will show you the other side of what it is!! Man o Man this helped me in many situations more than anything else

I'm having a tough times last 2 years but whenever I'm down I used to watch this and the Willsmith video from Yes theory which will give me a different perspective of life.

You guys are not only content creators you're rooted in my life in many situations which can't be explained so easily!!

I could write more than an essay how you have helped in each situation but with due respect. I just wanna say.. I love you Yes Theory!!!! for making our lives simple!!!! Love you Thomas for making our India proud!!!"
4793,PWLobZEIZG8,1:17 says who? Wiped out all of the native population wherever you been. Whosoever that bi$ch is needs to get schooled. This spoiled my mood.
4794,PWLobZEIZG8,❤‍🔥💪
4795,PWLobZEIZG8,I have a question.. has she(your gf) traveled to bangladesh??
4796,PWLobZEIZG8,"You guys should visit Brazil. But not Rio and São Paulo. The other side of Brazil. Bahia, Paraiba, Maranhão. It has the most remote places that are beautiful. I'm a filmmaker in Paraíba. It will be a pleasure to show you guys here. @Luccazapata. Hugs from Brazil."
4797,PWLobZEIZG8,Say yes to come to Brunei
4798,PWLobZEIZG8,Ffs.. India is far less a harsh place to travel than so many places.. I love this channel but that was unnecessary fear factor added in..
4799,PWLobZEIZG8,"I was bit skeptical for Thomas, as he was eating the pani puri on the road side. Foreigners should always drink bottled water and eat at hygienic Restaurants, he could have ended up with a bad stomach. Good he survived the garam masalas 😄."

Watching some of yes theory videos tonight to try and trick myself into believing that I'll find positives from this even though I don't think I'll find any."
4804,BdTWh6dfye4,one of my favorite yes theory videos
4805,BdTWh6dfye4,"Its sobering and terrifying to think we are all one life time event from being homeless. 
From time to time I do find myself thinking what would i do in this situation especially as I came close to being homeless once."
4806,BdTWh6dfye4,"My brother was homeless at one point in his life, so I could only imagine what it felt like. 😔"
4807,BdTWh6dfye4,Respect ❤
4808,BdTWh6dfye4,"4:42 The reason for not picking out a bottle is your whole life the trash can is for getting rid not surviving. For a homeless person a trash can can save their life, with just one thing they need."

4810,BdTWh6dfye4,"I had this life for almost 10 months on the streets of Greece ( patras, Athena) I was having a good life in Cyprus as a student, and a small mistake made a homeless but in another country which is Greece, I was literally eating from garbage, and after this I walked illegally between borders so I can get to Italy, and the walk took more than 17 months passing from Albania to get to Austria , really appreciate the fact you talked about this subject ( by the way iam from Morocco)"
4811,BdTWh6dfye4,"I love the walking shot, really made it dynamich"

4819,BdTWh6dfye4,❤❤❤12:36 ❤❤❤❤❤
4820,BdTWh6dfye4,"I know this was 3 years ago.  And that I know he made it through okay.  But I still felt like a worried mom with Ammar all alone, cold and hungry."
4821,BdTWh6dfye4,"First thing I would do is to find shelter, and food. I would ask people where the shelters are, and go there first.   People know.  Well at least I think they do here. I would go into a shop and ask if they know where there's a homeless shelter, if they can find it on the internet for me.   Then I would go there.  And I would ask them to look up where there's free food. At least in my city, there's listings of free food giveaways, food banks, shelters.  My Dad told me if you are lost in a city w no place to go, you can always go to the police and sleep in a cell.  ... But yeah, shelter and food and water and bathrooms, I would be scoping out."
4822,QjU8m24aQ8Y,These guys are really living the best lives! 11/29/2023
4823,QjU8m24aQ8Y,I really hope the dodge caravan i just bought doesn't break down. Same year same color as yours.

4825,QjU8m24aQ8Y,I came back after four years to just watch this video again. Man so much positivity. I hope to see you guys in person. Hopefully I ever get a chance to do so.

4842,EFV2cQtnCK8,First
4843,EFV2cQtnCK8,Didn't know this many adults who weren't geriatric or had a disability poop their pants. I guess I'm lucky
4844,EFV2cQtnCK8,I like this but it is relentlessly heterosexual.
4845,EFV2cQtnCK8,"I would have totally went to this, haha"
4846,EFV2cQtnCK8,"Yes Theory Match making in the comments:

Hey strangers, where you from?"
4847,EFV2cQtnCK8,"been following yes theory for god knows how long.. while i was rewatching this vid and reading through all the comments.. 
did anyone notice what happened at 13:40 ? :D :D"
4848,EFV2cQtnCK8,Did anyone cath the girl at 13:38 😂
4849,EFV2cQtnCK8,lmao did anyone catch what was happening at 13:40??
4850,EFV2cQtnCK8,Love it! Do more of these.
4851,EFV2cQtnCK8,GOCH YA  ! @Sorelle Amore Finance  @10:35 😁
4852,EFV2cQtnCK8,Sorelle!
4853,EFV2cQtnCK8,What about the gays
4854,EFV2cQtnCK8,"Gotta love the summer city at the end, really fits the video"
4855,EFV2cQtnCK8,"Austin was a beast, saying : ""Done"" :)) before thomas even finished. :))))"
4856,EFV2cQtnCK8,"👊🏾💫.RR!S$,"
4857,EFV2cQtnCK8,I like how you have a certain time limit to pull off great events such as this. Awesome!🤙
4858,EFV2cQtnCK8,"At sometimes i think what is youth of US and A doing in nation building, They are so emotional, have a lot of relationship issues , Dropping out of school, universities . Not a right direction, Must introspect ."
4859,EFV2cQtnCK8,I'm not sure if anyone has said this already but at 7:43 the eye contact thing is literally SOOO smart!
4860,EFV2cQtnCK8,"Watching these videos, I can relate to Matt cause I hate selling. I can relate to Ammar, to once having a dream about wanting all my friends to meet each other. I don't know how to relate to Thomas yet. But, makes you feel less alone."
4861,EFV2cQtnCK8,Disappointing.
4862,TA5Ilzauebo,❤
4863,TA5Ilzauebo,"Funny, Louis CK touched on this like 15 years ago on Conan. Pretty much said exactly what this guy said, just less eloquently"
4864,TA5Ilzauebo,"Considering your job literally is social media, I don't get how the time on your phone each day is so tiny!"
4865,TA5Ilzauebo,no way the like button on this video lit up when you were talking about it that was freaky
4866,TA5Ilzauebo,"Great idea, to use it as a power tool for example learning new things and sharing your passion like I share my music but stopping the endless scrolling and instead focussing on creating art, creating content, then sharing that and getting off social media again-without checking up on likes and comments every two minutes -Thats my kinda takeaway from it ☺"
4867,TA5Ilzauebo,ill randomly wake up tap instagram or twitter and keep scrolling or be at work walking and scrolling or outside even which is dangerous. im quitting officially today idk im wasting too many hours
4868,TA5Ilzauebo,"I'm 71 in a couple of weeks. For most of my life I never had a phone. I only access social media etc when I get home, as I rarely take my phone out with me. There's nothing more annoying than having to listen to one side of someone's phone conversation when your travelling on the bus or train or everybody just staring at their phones. Life's too short to be staring at a screen all the time, imo."
4869,TA5Ilzauebo,Can you do this video again 2023 edition
4870,TA5Ilzauebo,I deleted social media and will see what’s going to be. Will write after :)
4871,TA5Ilzauebo,Damn it's been more than 4 years for me already without social media. I'm never looking back again. This video helped me immensely. Thank you Yes Theory <3
4872,TA5Ilzauebo,The fact that you watch this masterpiece in your phone
4873,TA5Ilzauebo,I’m doing it. Starting today.
4874,TA5Ilzauebo,"sometimes i wonder if the stock footage people watch yes theory videos and see their face and smile, like.... guys... i made it :')"
4875,TA5Ilzauebo,"Would love to see more videos like these. Feel like this subject is even bigger now, especially after the pandemic."
4876,TA5Ilzauebo,just the low degree anxiety it causes is enough of a reason for me. I will do this at a certain point in my life for sure. cutting smoking comes first! Lets go!
4877,TA5Ilzauebo,"Jesus loves everyone and died on the cross for your sins and rose again three days later♥ Heaven and hell are both real places and we will be spending eternity in one of those places. Repent and put your trust in Him today and if you don't know how to reply to this comment♥ If you're already a born again Christian,(Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.”) John 3:3,  live for Him everyday and represent Him everywhere you go. Be a light for Him so that others that are lost will come to God. ♥ God bless you."
4878,TA5Ilzauebo,"This will be my last YouTube video I am watching this year.

Love y'all and see you on the other side. ❤"
4879,TA5Ilzauebo,3 years later do you still have the apps deleted? And download every 3 days
4880,TA5Ilzauebo,لع\ن الله حكومة ال سلول العا£هرا£ت عشاق الژ@ب
4881,TA5Ilzauebo,Do you or anyone have any tips on how to do this but the fear of being alone when you don't really have a massive support system? Been wanting to do this but am afraid of isolation if that makes sense?
4882,ukoSPO0cycE,Absolutely love it!
4883,ukoSPO0cycE,Total global you tube legends is that accurate er (yes)
4884,ukoSPO0cycE,boring .
4885,ukoSPO0cycE,"Yo I wrote that “GODLY” tag in the middle of the seek discomfort sign in 14:36. I was living in my van after dipping out on a bad internship in Joshua tree… my mom called me from there today… there’s lots of other synchronicity I could go on about 4EVA. I lost that vehicle this year due to some ish I ain’t even tryna yap about and it is so odd I started watching all of your guys’ videos this year. 
I kinda wanna ckry right now bekuz I’m holding on to a lot of meaning that I’m not sharing in the comments… the beauty in how I spotted this means so much and I’ve been feeling like I don’t know what to do sometimes I feel like my angels have my back, yet I’m afraid to be crazy enough to feel like I have it figured out.. so if anything I want to thank you for this moment we get to share. Btw I did ckry and it couldn’t of felt better!"

4900,ukoSPO0cycE,This was a banger idea
4901,ukoSPO0cycE,Such an awesome idea 👏 i might leave something like this in my town too
4902,cQFVeh6PCSQ,Thank you for watching guys! What would you want the next Yes House to have?? We'd love to hear your ideas. Much love
4903,cQFVeh6PCSQ,What was the channel before Yes Theory..?
4904,cQFVeh6PCSQ,spent so much money  for this house and only stay there for couple years.
4905,cQFVeh6PCSQ,i love you guys. always seeking positive vibes.
4906,cQFVeh6PCSQ,THE OLD MAN AND THE KID. WOW. YES THEORY FAM COMES IN ALL AGES AND SPECTRUMS OF LIFE.
4907,cQFVeh6PCSQ,"only couple years in a place!! LOL I've been in my place for 8yrs omg!! My son was 7yr old!! and wish I could say something good about wish, they took forever to mail me anything.
I love this vid, I cried too."
4908,cQFVeh6PCSQ,"I wasn't there with Yes Theory when they were still Project 30 then became Generation Y Not. But because I've watched every single video of them from the start till this, I feel so emotional about this video. They had a lot of memories that they shared together in that house. Yes Theory was literally born there, as they said. 😭"
4909,cQFVeh6PCSQ,I LOVE THAT YOU GAVE THAT  little  BOY EXTRA TIME :) <3 I love love love YES THEORY...... Ya'll always make me cry of joy!
4910,cQFVeh6PCSQ,this is some of the worst hollywood fake party ive ever seen. Nobody has a party where 60 people stand in a room and jump.
4911,cQFVeh6PCSQ,Should have invited Homeless people from nearby area and asked them to takeaway whatever they wanted because it would have actually helped the needy.
4912,cQFVeh6PCSQ,250th🤪
4913,cQFVeh6PCSQ,They must’ve had the coolest neighbors/landlord
4914,cQFVeh6PCSQ,"I’m not crying, you are😭"
4915,cQFVeh6PCSQ,That moment when you’re listening to Yes Theory & the add that plays is Seek Discomfort XD
4916,cQFVeh6PCSQ,Thomas is low key a douche lmfao.
4917,cQFVeh6PCSQ,Best family on youtube🤩🤩
4918,cQFVeh6PCSQ,"Really cool video, but I think it‘s sad that you partnered with wish. I‘ve had several negative experiences with wish, and I‘m not the only one. I‘m talking items that never arrived, blatant fakes sold as originals etc etc. I think you’re a great channel, but I hope you won‘t partner with companies such as wish again."
4919,cQFVeh6PCSQ,"Who is this person? At 0:45 (with the three people), who is the person on the right?

I’ve seen him in a few videos. The reason I remembered him was because of his roll in Yes Theory.
In a couple different videos, they mention that he was one of the founders. And is one of the owners of Yes Theory.

What is his roll? What is his position, and what does he do? How big of a “partner” is he? How much does he “own”? What percentage?"
4920,cQFVeh6PCSQ,imagine getting a seek discomfort ad in the middle of a Yes theory video
4921,cQFVeh6PCSQ,The red backback which was picked before is back on the couch at 11:33 xD
4922,8cvhwquPqJ0,Nothing than ice cold love for this production!! 🦾
4923,8cvhwquPqJ0,😂😂😂😂The guys freaking out is cracking me up lol
4924,8cvhwquPqJ0,"awesome message guys

grateful"
4925,8cvhwquPqJ0,"Hello, I am Francisco from Chile, first of all, thank you for the service you provide to humanity. I want to ask a question about the breathing technique... It is seen in the video that a boy has an involuntary reaction manifesting spasms and loss of control of his movements and you can see that he is out of his mind... then you assist him by taking him by under the neck and squeezing a point on the trapezius... what happens if you are alone practicing this breathing at that level and something similar happens to you and there is no one who can help you or if there is someone but they do not know how to react to this event? ?Thanks, I'll stay tuned."
4926,8cvhwquPqJ0,Cool guys!!!!
4927,8cvhwquPqJ0,Gracias maestro por esta enseñanza 🙏
4928,8cvhwquPqJ0,nice
4929,8cvhwquPqJ0,Where is the Russian translation??? Why can't I enter them????
4930,8cvhwquPqJ0,Где русские субтитры ??? Почему нельзя их вставить ????
4931,8cvhwquPqJ0,The one guy spasming during the breathing exervise reminded me of neo being reborn into the real world in the matrix.
4932,8cvhwquPqJ0,You were an inspiration to me. I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to learn from you. You taught me that there's no shortcut to success and that reaching your goal isn't easy. You're a very helpful and supportive person in my life.❤
4933,8cvhwquPqJ0,He is one amazing man who is changing ❤ the world 🌎 love from  ireland 🇮🇪
4934,8cvhwquPqJ0,❤️
4935,8cvhwquPqJ0,i love it guys perfect to prepare me for my 50km bike ride in freezing temperatures and deadlifting 705lbs afterwards
4936,8cvhwquPqJ0,the girl was the bravest one in the cold water. she does not have to shout like  the weak men.
4937,8cvhwquPqJ0,"The accomplishments speak for themselves exaggerating them is both unnecessary and undermines credibility when it’s not needed.  

I do not believe it’s fair to say that he got to the top of Mount Everest in his shorts or that he even stood in the death zone at or above 26,000’.    That’s like fake news.  Being on a mountain is not the same thing as being on top of that mountain, or even up its flanks to 26,000’.  

Please correct me if I am wrong about this."
4938,8cvhwquPqJ0,So impressive
4939,8cvhwquPqJ0,"The boys weep like babies do... Clearly, this girl is carrying the balls, haha"
4940,8cvhwquPqJ0,"Fuck you guys you are rocking

4943,8qi5shrtn60,"Even though you're not technically endorsing, just use shopping at and saying the name of a story you go to means you're advertising on their behalf. Home Depot is a homophobic conservative company that's anti women's rights. Probably better to just go with Lowe's next time"
4944,8qi5shrtn60,"Are they really leaving all the furniture, pictures and stuff there or are they just not done moving it out? This is a pretty awesome video though. ❤"
4945,8qi5shrtn60,I want to go on a date with Matt Dajer!!!

4949,8qi5shrtn60,"Elle Mills is so hot. She can marry me for a passport. 
Lol"
4950,8qi5shrtn60,"Rubbish last ""magic"" trick, she watched his hand draw circles as he did it deliberately right in front of her n says ""watch this"" then he made sure she saw the symbol as he turned it to show others! This puts social peer pressure on her to try n recreate same symbol fr the video as all eyes on her....which she has already seen.🤣🤣🤣🤣"
4951,8qi5shrtn60,Allen always there….coolest dude ever
4952,8qi5shrtn60,they forgot check in and room cards!
4953,8qi5shrtn60,"nothing is impossible with the yes theory

4962,WZXPxRwZwYE,"So stoked to be back, we're going to start rolling out videos consistently again. To partake in future meet-ups and potentially go on adventure like this with us, make sure you follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/yestheory/"

4979,WZXPxRwZwYE,I’m going to Japan this Thursday! So excited!
4980,WZXPxRwZwYE,"I would love to meet you in Africa but you are probably too old for your group. I’m 65 and I’m actually handicapped from MS.  I love watching everything you guys do and everywhere you go. I just found you so I have a lot of catching up to do but I’ve been watching you all day every day last week between it all the other stuff so I guess his butt all day but it’s a lot because I love you guys, I love what you do bringing the world together .♥️♥️💯"
4981,WZXPxRwZwYE,Yes theory please come back here in Japan. wish!!!
4982,M7KH0Q5_1fI,"Money is the only thing that's ever stood in my way. Every single thing cost money, to pursue your dreams, to be happy, to travel, to thrive, it'll cost money and I've never had that. I'm one paycheck away right now from being homeless and I have been my entire adult life. There's no social pressure keeping me from doing anything. Just living in a pure shit country called America is the problem"
4983,M7KH0Q5_1fI,how hard was it for them to renew visa and stay permits to live there more than a few months?
4984,M7KH0Q5_1fI,"i would like to take a care giver job ""live in"" but those jobs require  a decent car with good insurance..  i think it would not only be rewarding but also give me a roof over my head... the new job would allow me to cook and clean and take the care needer to doctors appointments, shopping and activities like bingo, putt putt, movies etc"
4985,M7KH0Q5_1fI,i don't look my age and when i ask for a senior discount they laugh and then i have to show proof of age lol
4986,M7KH0Q5_1fI,"that would be cool ... but what about older people?  age discrimination is real and leaves us with low or no options... when will you reach out to seniors citizens?
especially one's who have trouble getting their social security and have no decent place to live...  i personally had a motorcycle accident and lost everything and trying to save to get a car and a place to stay it's really hard"
4987,M7KH0Q5_1fI,I still think about this video from 4 years ago and wonder what ever happened with them?? we NEED an update pls!
4988,M7KH0Q5_1fI,Ammar “peace the fuck out I’m tired of acting on camera” 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭 bahahahha omg I’m dyingggggg
4989,M7KH0Q5_1fI,did she think bali was in the philippines?
4990,M7KH0Q5_1fI,"Nerd alert: If I got 10k I would pursue my dream of going to Sri Lanka to document the differences between the Poecilotheria species living in both the highlands and lowlands (in both pictures and text) and write a book about it. For those wondering what the heck Poecilotheria is, it's a genus of arboreal tarantulas."
4991,M7KH0Q5_1fI,I would absolutely jump for joy and send my resignation letter within the same hour!!!!!! I work in retail and do music on the side.. but I really want to kickstart my business ventures to fund my music career but my luck at finding business funding has been extremely hard and my work hours take up most of my time. I could change lives with 10k and flip it into 100k within a year. What a dream!
4992,M7KH0Q5_1fI,I must have missed something but how do the two of them plan on living off $10k for 10 months?
4993,M7KH0Q5_1fI,Man this makes me so sad and happy at same time cause I left home cause my grandparents and uncle passed now I'm 2000 miles away and with a new tattoo
4994,M7KH0Q5_1fI,I was just saying this to my roommate
4995,M7KH0Q5_1fI,"I really wish all the people you guys helped out would have a recap video about how YESTHEORY brought change to their lives, have they reached their goals ? im just curious"
4996,M7KH0Q5_1fI,oh wait did I hear in the Philippines?wow!
4997,M7KH0Q5_1fI,oh it's 5 years of hard working for me
4998,M7KH0Q5_1fI,Is there an update on this?

5022,CDxBjrWxcII,"Here I am in October of 2023 in tears thinking about the “kid” watching this depressed in 2018 working 70+ hours a week in manufacturing hating my life and hoping that I could escape into YouTube videos. I embraced the seek discomfort mantra and went back to college. Graduated, met my wife, stepped out of the biggest comfort zone and into a new career! I have been truly blessed by this channel and will always give support where I can!"
5023,CDxBjrWxcII,I come back and watch this video whenever I need some motivation. You guys are so incredible!
5024,CDxBjrWxcII,this video is great.
5025,CDxBjrWxcII,"To this day, this is still one of my favourite videos. Thank you Yes Theory!"
5026,CDxBjrWxcII,I needed this today more than air
5027,CDxBjrWxcII,I just cried..
5028,CDxBjrWxcII,"if not ur videos and your positivity in like 2017-2019 i had never had a courage to do what i have done and achieve so much more than i thought possible, thank you"
5029,CDxBjrWxcII,my first step is to start
5030,CDxBjrWxcII,"its 2022. my dream my whole life, as a girl. was to be a mechanic. a car, a ship, wherever i end up,  machines. Sometimes they make me believe that they have a bigger soul than me or you. i was always told to step aside, because its not a girls profession, i will never make it, stopped talking about my dreams with people, and started to talk about them with cars. Everyone sees a ,,person"" differently and im happy to say, that in 2022, as a now freshman in a marine college, im studying ship mechanics, defending myself everyday from professors, who should not even be alive by now, more so teaching, im studying, what i always hoped for and something other people made me believe i am not capable. This is my first step, and what is yours?"
5031,CDxBjrWxcII,Yes theory brought tears in my eyes ...... I don't know why ...you guys are awesome !!!! and so so kind!!!!🥰
5032,CDxBjrWxcII,Yes Theory actually impacted so many people’s lives. It's way beyond just a youtube channel.
5033,CDxBjrWxcII,This. This is my dream.
5034,CDxBjrWxcII,"What a great video! So ... In my wildest dreams I have a full control over my lower part of the body. Severe consequences of spinal cord injuries are thing of the past, we are generation who learns how to heal, not only deal with SCI. Huh, can not believe I wrote it down, kinda believe in that power of the Universe. And as I am writing this I already feel the shivers all along my legs and back all the way to the finger tips. Thank you for this inspirational video, let's take some baby steps today!"
5035,CDxBjrWxcII,This video helped me a lot this past weeks where I been felling lost in life .  It helped me to get out of my comfort zone and to really start acting and chancing  my  life slowly !!
5036,CDxBjrWxcII,My babystep to my goal is: I'm going to watch a lot of your video's and figure out what I want to do with my life! :D
5037,CDxBjrWxcII,I want to become Pakistan's best Tennis player
5038,CDxBjrWxcII,Who is the guy at 1:50?
5039,CDxBjrWxcII,Taking my first step towards all my goals well be happy to look back on this one year from now!   8/1/22 -
5040,CDxBjrWxcII,Great video
5041,CDxBjrWxcII,This is the BEST YouTube video I have seen in a LONG time! Thank you!
5042,G9HcQvAFnvs,What's your biggest dream? What's holding you back from taking the first step?
5043,G9HcQvAFnvs,"One of the most destructive things I did was ever go to college. It's put me in lifelong debt. I actually paid off what the actual cost of my student loans were probably a decade ago, but because of the, what should be illegal, level of Interest rates, I am nowhere near paying off my debt and never will be useless with the level of degree I have so it was literally all for nothing and I'm one check away from being homeless pretty much every single month"
5044,G9HcQvAFnvs,he have to get in shape
5045,G9HcQvAFnvs,Dude this guys karma is gold
5046,G9HcQvAFnvs,"""i turned my life around 360 degrees"" 😹😹😹"
5047,G9HcQvAFnvs,A big Thank  you  C. HATFIELD...XO
5048,G9HcQvAFnvs,He made his masters in 2022 ✨
5049,G9HcQvAFnvs,"""You are the prime factor in creating your own future"" - Chris Hadfield, 2018"
5050,G9HcQvAFnvs,"""There is nobody I enjoy helping more, than people who are helping themselves"" - Matt, 2018"
5051,G9HcQvAFnvs,"It’s incredible how generous yes theory is. YouTubers don’t even make that much money, especially four years ago"
5052,G9HcQvAFnvs,❤️
5053,G9HcQvAFnvs,YAY RYAN!!!! I look forward to following your career
5054,G9HcQvAFnvs,"I just noticed the ""Mad Magazine' fold in the See Discomfort logo on Matt's sweatshirt. Awesome and clever!!!"
5055,G9HcQvAFnvs,"God I wish it was 2018 again……… sure things are mainly good for me now but a lot of things just seemed a bit more simple then. Less loss, and destruction in the world."
5056,G9HcQvAFnvs,"Would be nice to see, what has become of him. Or more people that you have featured on Yes Theory! Because at the end of the Day, this is what your videos should be all about."
5057,G9HcQvAFnvs,😍😍😍
5058,G9HcQvAFnvs,"This is the best Yes Theory video, hands down! I really wish they would get back to doing more charitable things like this. I understand they do a lot for random subscribers in videos still, but they are so trivial compared to this. Seeing the joy on Ryan's face was just priceless, and it's really sad that this video doesn't have more views."
5059,G9HcQvAFnvs,7:20 my favorite part of this video.
5060,G9HcQvAFnvs,LOVE  IT  😃👏👏👏🙌
5061,G9HcQvAFnvs,Yer its late but I'd love to the most the holy man I have always looked up to the icon of all I love sir David attenborough.
5062,ER1o2nL5bEc,"Hope you enjoy seeing Matt going through this insane mental and physical journey.. For those who are interested, https://www.seekdiscomfort.com/ is still available for a few more weeks. Much love!"
5063,ER1o2nL5bEc,I think 5 days would be too much for me to try straight away. Would I get any benefit from 48 hours? What about 48 hours twice a month? Or does it have to be 5 days or more in order for the chemical and biological stuff to work properly?
5064,ER1o2nL5bEc,Your heart palpitations is from low electrolytes. You should never fast without replenishing electrolytes Google decreased potassium and magnesium symptoms . Just drink a coconut water everyday when doing something like this. If anyone is thinking I’d doing this.
5065,ER1o2nL5bEc,i’ll try it
5066,ER1o2nL5bEc,"If you do a fast being a Christian, you can do it for up to 40 days. Jesus fasted for 40 and 40 nights when he was on earth"
5067,ER1o2nL5bEc,Just seen the video in 2023. I’m going to try the challenge starting September 25th after 6am breakfast. I will respond to my own comment for updates. Video really motivated me
5068,ER1o2nL5bEc,The zen thing he's talking about is true. I experienced it
5069,ER1o2nL5bEc,"I am a follower of Yeshua, and when the Lord hears your sacrifice in fasting it’s a spiritual thing. What he does is very different because it’s just the body. When you fast to the Lord you are physically and spiritually touched. Physically you give something up, but spiritually you pray for people, read the Bible, and serve others all day and you just be a living sacrifice. I’ve done this for 4 days once and God used a friend of mine to tell me to stop fasting and he took me on an adventure. The Lord is real. Yeshua is real and the only way. I pray you both get to know him one day. He died on the cross for our sins and rose 3 days later, so that you may have eternal life and a relationship with him and the Father. You guys need the Holy Spirit which gives you all the water you’ve been searching for. Your friend is thirsty too, but Jesus says to come drink and you will never thirst again. Religion is the outward , but the one true God sees the heart and works from the inside out. He is the Lord and aside from him there is no God. I know you (is it Amar?) are very religious, but many people are religious but don’t have the Holy Spirit. The Lord wants to show you who he is,and show you the truth. Jesus said “I am the way, the truth, and the life, no man come to the father except through me.” Jesus is the only way, and I felt strongly to let you know that. Our practices can’t save us, hard work can’t save us, ultimately faith in Jesus saves us. Our works can’t atone you guys, but the finished work on Calvary can. Lay your burdens down, toss your idols aside, and please I encourage you to get to know Jesus, because one day it will be too late and the truth will be known but no longer available. All who commit sin of any kind and never repent which means turns away, are cast into the lake of fire, body and soul destroyed . The wages of sin is eternal death, but Jesus is eternal life, peace love and joy, holiness, righteousness is only found in him. Healing from depression, anxiety, anger, trauma, resentment, relationships, and so much more can only be healed by Jesus. I know I’m seemingly to issue a challenge, but learning the truth takes time for many. I just encourage you guys to take one day to ask the Lord Jesus to reveal himself to you, and watch the making things that happen. We all struggle so much within because we try to atone ourselves or fill that void we all have that God(Yehovah) placed in us so we could find him. Jesus already paid the price, if you give your sinful life to him , your sins are forgiven. They are wide clean no longer remembered as long as you walk in his righteousness, not trusting your own which none have. You guys need him and his Holy Spirit, because this is how you are made whole one day. Jesus is coming back soon. I pray you guys don’t wait. I mean you no harm, but I feel strongly to warn you all to turn away from sin, idolatry is one, confusion is another issue, turn toward the living God who’s Holy Spirit is all around you. Ask God speaks his word goes forth and things happen. We are living in the 6th seal that the Lord has opened. False peace will deceive many. Please don’t fall for it. Only those who know Jesus can see this, because it’s a spiritual battle. I’m not saying it because this my religion and Yada yada, it’s because I see the emptiness in you guys by the Lord showing me, as sweet as you guys are, you have a lot of sorrow, and this emptiness that cause you to try and fall it with this world. You guys need Jesus. Ask him to reveal himself to you guys, he loves you so much. He watched over you as a kid and oversees you now as adults. He wants to heal you guys. Please don’t wait. I love you no matter what, but I have to tell you this, because at least you heard it. Please don’t put off salvation, do put up with religious observance of man made practice, and forsake the sweet relationship with the Lord. He wants to set you guys free. God showed me chains you are both under, idolatry is one(please I mean you no harm but I have to share the truth, confusion is another. You guys have no idea how heavy those chains are and they drag you down daily. Now is the day of salvation, I pray you don’t wait. He wants to show you real undeniable truth. He can show you in dreams, visions, from people. He can show you what’s real and what’s not, all you have to do is ask. God bless you guys. I love you all so much. I love these videos. Shalom to you. May the Lord show you the truth soon through a supernatural encounter and you both be changed forever. In Jesus name Amen."
5070,ER1o2nL5bEc,"The more extended fasts you do, the easier it is to go longer. I just finished a three day fast. Next month I'll do four or five days.

The people at Bulletproof should have told you how to break your fast properly."
5071,ER1o2nL5bEc,"The human stomach endures food inside the stomach for 4 hours to three and half hours after a meal. After 4 hours the food passes out of the  stomach and  the person with the stomach is hungry. However the human body is designed with the caveman in mind. With unlimited supply of clean water, a caveman and family used to go on with no solid food for two three days without food till the next hunt. Kind of like the Flintstone family of cavemen in cartoons."
5072,ER1o2nL5bEc,"cool challenge and video but sorry to say your body is not rebuilding itself 🫣 also there are absolutely NO scientific evidence for any of those claims 🤣 
yes fasting can be beneficial if you are needing to lose weight and can be a tool for weight lose but none of those other claims are actually proven to be true"
5073,ER1o2nL5bEc,Today is my 5th day fasting but I feel I cheated I had 1 bottle of ice tea a day but I'm still not hungry today
5074,ER1o2nL5bEc,"They call it breakfast  because when you go to sleep and wake up in the moring and eat you are breaking your fast. ""breakfast"""
5075,ER1o2nL5bEc,pancake bite was the best
5076,ER1o2nL5bEc,"Me with ed, who ate nothing already three days, watching this: how bizarre 🗿"
5077,ER1o2nL5bEc,Before I start this video you should be fine without food for 5 days but I wouldn't recommend doing it on your first try because your body needs to adjust to the changes also intermittent fasting will help there is no need to eat breakfast everyday either breakfast just means to break fast and our body uses energy to digest our food we only really need to eat once a day if that.
5078,ER1o2nL5bEc,So u failed acter 2 days🙈
5079,ER1o2nL5bEc,"I done this, and keeping God close by and thanking him throughout my fast was brilliant. I felt spiritually cleansed, I felt fitter and healthier in my mind. It is difficult but so so beneficial."
5080,ER1o2nL5bEc,"Had a root canal, and went 6 days without.  It was actually a great feeling.  Going to incorporate it into my life from now on"
5081,ER1o2nL5bEc,I love the way you present yourself and you have a wonderful friend

5135,kZ_iBZ-Saq0,Thank you for inspiring me❤❤👌
5136,kZ_iBZ-Saq0,"One thing I have gotten from watching a couple pf these videos - I am yet to complete all the videos from both channels - is that I have to INVEST in the right kind of friends.  There's no shortcut if I want to go out of my comfort zone and achieve my dreams.  I have to be the right person not just for myself but for the people around me, and the people around me must be the right kind of people for me.   That synergy is totally important coz going out of ones comfort zone means you'll bear your soul out and the people around you need to be safe people to whom your can be vulnerable with without fear or judgement."

I wonder what was the reaction of her teacher. haha"
5162,ehkFvYRCLUk,"It sucks because I've been trying to give homeless meals my entire life, and almost every time it backfires in some way because of the reaction of the homeless person. I've offered food and been asked all the ingredients and it's been rejected because it didn't have something they wanted or it had something they didn't like. I've offered food from a restaurant that I was about to go to that I saw a homeless person near and they instead begged me for a ride to take them wherever, making it extremely awkward come on but most of the time I offer food and they reject it. It's really really weird"

5165,ehkFvYRCLUk,Bruh this is the best i have seen ever this is amazing ❤😂 i was laughing so hard
5166,ehkFvYRCLUk,"As someone from Sacramento, this brought so much JOY to my heart! She is a real standup, classy person :’) as well as her family too"
5167,ehkFvYRCLUk,"""Hey i just met you last night after you randomly called me asked to meet me. You can drive my kids around without me in the car"" the amount of anxiety i have as a parent watching that."
5168,ehkFvYRCLUk,Tack! Keep doing what you doing!
5169,ehkFvYRCLUk,I would love to meet you guys some day. You guys are so inspirational to the whole world

5172,ehkFvYRCLUk,"There couldn't have been a better stranger to do this with. She feeds the homeless and talks to random people, she is just an amazing person all around. ❤"
5173,ehkFvYRCLUk,"I was homeless in vegas for a good 8-9 months, i ate out of dumpsters and was excited when i found full untouched food, but overrall if it werent for people like hannah aswell i probably wouldnt be here"
5174,ehkFvYRCLUk,I love this one so much 💛💛💛 I come back to it years later
5175,ehkFvYRCLUk,"im watching this 4 years later, and follow up with hannah and her family? its been awhile and her and her family seemed awesome."
5176,ehkFvYRCLUk,y'all making me cry again ...
5177,ehkFvYRCLUk,hannah was my great great great... grandma Hannah Dustin... first woman in America to have a statue erected for courage
5178,ehkFvYRCLUk,"I know this  was done 4 years ago. When an unknown caller calls my phone, I tap a screening service that speaks for me and asks why you are calling etc. and I can read the reply on the screen and pick up if I want. I have been following you for several months and love what you are doing. If I wasn't so dang old, I would want to go on adventures with you!"
5179,ehkFvYRCLUk,"i just smiled half of the video

can you guys please do this again  : )"
5180,ehkFvYRCLUk,Rewatching this in 2023 got me missing Matt😭
5181,ehkFvYRCLUk,Hannah is sooooo cool!
5182,Vs6In7UtyXY,THANKS so much guys for pulling me into this. One year later and I'm still completely unemployable for publicly lying to the news. But hey at least the world thought for a split second that Justin Bieber ate a burrito sideways. Totally. Worth. It. 😆
5183,Vs6In7UtyXY,Why are you retards acting surprised snd like no way! Holy shit! No freaking waay! Wtf?! The guy is dressed to look like Justin Bieber. Its a normal fucking reaction
5184,Vs6In7UtyXY,5:44 This woman's voice is very beautiful
5185,Vs6In7UtyXY,This was the first Yes Theory video I watched around 5 years ago in late 2018 and it was quite an introduction to the channel.
5186,Vs6In7UtyXY,If you're not offended you're not american 💀
5187,Vs6In7UtyXY,Here in Brazil it involves a process hahaha
5188,Vs6In7UtyXY,That's how you know the media don't do research before publishing it to the world
5189,Vs6In7UtyXY,"Wow, people are going crazy over how one person eats a burrito - whoever it is. This world is mad🤨"
5190,Vs6In7UtyXY,"And this is another reason why I don't envy famouse people, sad these things become news..."
5191,Vs6In7UtyXY,Now I see that the news is credible.
5192,Vs6In7UtyXY,shiiesh
5193,Vs6In7UtyXY,"Felicidades por ese montaje!!! Increible, y la magia de reddit"
5194,Vs6In7UtyXY,"It’s 5 years later and I can’t stop laughing at the idiots of MSM 🤣
This is legendary!"
5195,Vs6In7UtyXY,Thank you for showing us how the media works
5196,Vs6In7UtyXY,A proff that a boomer can be fooled on this new era. Especially now there's an AI
5197,Vs6In7UtyXY,"You cant pretend to be a celebrity and embarrasse them,they are also humans"
5198,Vs6In7UtyXY,That's*
5199,Vs6In7UtyXY,"Ok Guys that's not Ok, that s not cool.Justin is also a human"
5200,Vs6In7UtyXY,This video would not be visible if Justin Bieber wasn't even exist.
5201,Vs6In7UtyXY,So why is lying such a funny thing
5202,knfr0SUqJvI,Nothing is impossible... Check out 49th Parallel on Souncloud and follow us on Instagram @YesTheory for potentially an edition of saying yes to an Instagram DM.. and thank you to the 230 people from the Yes Fam that came and supported them perform!! 🙏
5203,knfr0SUqJvI,"Actually no, this didn't happen because of one simple email, this happened because of your following, the influence you have, the money you have, and the connections you have. Email was the most simplest thing to do with all of this"
5204,knfr0SUqJvI,"This is so heart warming. 
What’s the song at 8:47 ?"
5205,knfr0SUqJvI,This is dope!! Classic 🤝
5206,knfr0SUqJvI,july and august are teachers holidays so my availablity is open for then if you're looking for a video idea... sorry to chain comment ;0)
5207,knfr0SUqJvI,I have also been in 2 movies here I have a great agent and he is always looking for walk on parts or extras so we might be able to be in a movie too... thanks for your time YES THEORY and PEEPS
5208,knfr0SUqJvI,damn I wanna fuck that dudes mom
5209,knfr0SUqJvI,Come to south africa hav a party at my house i never had a party here
5210,knfr0SUqJvI,"Wait, why is there a Polish-sportsteam-cheering scarf on the chair Matt's sitting in at 09:15? There's the Polish coat of arms on it and it probably says ""Always faithful to those in white and red"" (those are the colours of our flag).
Anyways, time for an obligatory POLSKAAAA, BIAŁO-CZERWONI!!! :D"
5211,knfr0SUqJvI,"I love the kids mom, she was so awesome."
5212,knfr0SUqJvI,The number of bro slaps lol

5217,knfr0SUqJvI,Y’all were in Seattle and I didn’t know 😢😭 only 30 minutes away 🥺
5218,knfr0SUqJvI,"I mean, you did say no several times before cherry-picking a single yes."
5219,knfr0SUqJvI,That was so sweet
5220,knfr0SUqJvI,"I say, dont take your phone in the biffy. And if so.....dont answer it!!!!"
5221,knfr0SUqJvI,This goes so hard
5222,ODzFt_S0aXU,"It's so cool that no matter what choice you make, it is neither right or wrong, it's just a choice that opens another door which normally exposes you to a completely different part of life. Wine party preparation in Slovakia, another story to tell the grandkids. Love it x"
5223,ODzFt_S0aXU,"It's crazy to think that you can drive 4 hours and be in a different country, with a different language. I live in central Texas (Austin). I could travel any direction for 4 hours and still only be in Texas. How bland haha."
5224,ODzFt_S0aXU,8:12 He's certainly beekeeping age
5225,ODzFt_S0aXU,I love Hungary ❤
5226,ODzFt_S0aXU,Would be cool if it wasn't pre-planned
5227,ODzFt_S0aXU,"The Yes Theory is basically the art of getting your friends to do the stupidest things without even agreeing to what they are, what we call 'BLINDSIDED'. Should have really been named The Guy Theory."
5228,ODzFt_S0aXU,In the UK we call it a 'Stag Party'.
5229,ODzFt_S0aXU,Watching for the 3rd time😂 i just love Ammar's energy and positive disposition
5230,ODzFt_S0aXU,Funniest thing is that he was dropped like 15km from Bratislava main train station :)
5231,ODzFt_S0aXU,This is what the Internet was made for. Now can someone blow up Twitter... the anti-Yes Theory site. That site is totally the opposite of the human experience... very mean.
5232,ODzFt_S0aXU,You should check Bulgaria 
5233,ODzFt_S0aXU,Nahhhhhhhh idk why but it looks soooo fake
5234,ODzFt_S0aXU,Shout out to those kids ❤ they understood the assignment lol
5235,ODzFt_S0aXU,Omar is like...challange accepted
5236,ODzFt_S0aXU,Now is the time guys! Drop him off on a continent. Australia would be good.
5237,ODzFt_S0aXU,"So funny seeing you so lost in my little country 😂😂😂😂 but it was surely lovely to have you here, hope you’ll come back for a bigger adventure in our mountains!!🤩 or castles👀"
5238,ODzFt_S0aXU,what's music on 1:29 ? :)
5239,ODzFt_S0aXU,This looks and sounds scripted and fake…. Who on earth can go through airport security blindfolded 💩💩💩
5240,ODzFt_S0aXU,The Waffle House Has Found It’s New Host
5241,ODzFt_S0aXU,That was fun! 😄😄😀
5242,KSu6gRp7UBA,Thank you again to all of you who went and commented on Will Smith's video when we first challenged him. This all happened because of you and we dedicate this video to our amazing Yes Fam Community. We're forever dedicated to making content that empowers you to live your best lives. We love you! <3
5243,KSu6gRp7UBA,I watched to see Will Smith jump. How is that not included in the video? LOL
5244,KSu6gRp7UBA,Here after reading Will's book & subscribed
5245,KSu6gRp7UBA,"So many people gather, but only two of them jump?"
5246,KSu6gRp7UBA,"My best memory of Will Smith is on the set of ""I am Legend"". I was an extra in Manhattan. It was the third day of shooting with us extras and it was very cold! During a break in the shooting. Will Smith had everyone gather in a small circle and he did a little rap for everyone. It was just one of those moments that you never forget!"
5247,KSu6gRp7UBA,How cool would a  24hr survival catch and cook be to see from yes fam
5248,KSu6gRp7UBA,inssaaannnee
5249,KSu6gRp7UBA,will smith looks so young. How old is he?

5303,gupvbiaP5pg,5 years ago watching this I was like “what the heck is Luxembourg?” Flash forward and now I live here 🤣
5304,gupvbiaP5pg,The honey app is vile and gets the most catastrophically horrible reviews I've ever seen! Using it on your home computer it's a totally different experience and worth it
5305,gupvbiaP5pg,Did you see the bucktooth girl?
5306,gupvbiaP5pg,You need to make an episode about getting some real shoes to walk in for Matt 😂😊
5307,gupvbiaP5pg,So you aren't allowed to use a map but are allowed to ask people using google maps. 🧐
5308,gupvbiaP5pg,What?! You have been to my country?? 😂😂 awesome!
5309,gupvbiaP5pg,Im so confused
5310,gupvbiaP5pg,"I once walked 50k for a rogain in western australia and it was raining the whole time, so I know how you guys feel..."

5313,gupvbiaP5pg,Ahaaaa! So this is it! Wow! 😂😂😂😂
5314,gupvbiaP5pg,you should have go to singapore
5315,gupvbiaP5pg,You have Luxembourg (the Country and City) But Belgium has a Province thats called Luxembourg
5316,gupvbiaP5pg,Netherlands would be fun on bikes. Bike around the country on their bike paths.
5317,gupvbiaP5pg,You guys should do Lichtenstein next.
5318,gupvbiaP5pg,Fun episode! Best way to see Luxembourg.....otherwise you are in and out in a couple of hours.... including an hour's stop at a Luxembourg city street cafe!
5319,gupvbiaP5pg,"As I binge watch your videos, I am noticing a general theme. All the places you travel, humans are generally kind and helpful to one another. Thanks for showing a side of people we rarely get to see. I hope as time moves along, that us humans the one and only race on this planet, can truly learn to love and live in peace together."
5320,gupvbiaP5pg,"Wow I found it, the first Yes Theory video I ever watched 😭💛"

5323,eBZTY11KZsM,Got a text from yes theory about the event 🤔
5324,eBZTY11KZsM,"Hearing each runner one by one share their stories made me burst into tears. Yes Theory, you guys are doing incredible work with this channel demonstrating the powerful values of communication, empathy, compassion, and love. Your videos have truly inspired me to push past my deepest discomforts and feelings of self doubt. Please keep up the great work!"
5325,eBZTY11KZsM,This should be an annual event
5326,eBZTY11KZsM,Did the moon run happen?
5327,eBZTY11KZsM,I guess will's heart jumped when Chris rock made a gi Jane joke
5328,eBZTY11KZsM,"I'm extremely like this video basically positive in the life 
They were connected with all around in world by walking is keep us usually have  a good health to do more new things  it made my feelings gotta act immediately 
Thank you very much👊👊"
5329,eBZTY11KZsM,the beginning lol. will smith must be very scared of chris rock.

5342,Tv6AsFuBbUk,Thomas your funniest moments yet! Nailed the director
5343,Tv6AsFuBbUk,Matt and Thomas commercial soooo funnyyyy😂😂😂😂
5344,Tv6AsFuBbUk,2:48 is I swear a shot stolen from the dart on a map video haha and the unannounced and unadressed cameo from Zac Alsop is crazy :P
5345,Tv6AsFuBbUk,It's 2023 and Thomas being a complete weirdo is still the best Seek Discomfort commercial ever! 😂
5346,Tv6AsFuBbUk,dude i was dying with the italian dude
5347,Tv6AsFuBbUk,"The fact that they walked up to a man who's fear was talking to strangers was the most perfect thing that could have happened. In recent times with all of the bad in the world the best thing that people can do is talk and communicate, or even just wave/hang out (because not everyone can speak the same language), with one another"
5348,Tv6AsFuBbUk,"@Yes Theory 
you guys should do a video where somehow you guys choose 3 random locations and draw them out of a hat, and Thomas, Matt and Ammar have to fly to which ever location they draw.... that would be a great sequel to this video!!!!"
5349,Tv6AsFuBbUk,You should have come to Cologne 😅 I would‘ve showed you a lot more fun than that 🥺❤️
5350,Tv6AsFuBbUk,Finally the first “puerto rican” I’ve heard in a while
5351,Tv6AsFuBbUk,thomas n tommy  so funny
5352,Tv6AsFuBbUk,The challenge with the shy guy actually brought tears to my eyes 💖. Very emotional...
5353,Tv6AsFuBbUk,"Dare I say you guys cheated. This wasn't a monkey that decided, but an orangutan."
5354,Tv6AsFuBbUk,i would surgest going to boppart and rudesim sorry for the bad spellings
5355,Tv6AsFuBbUk,That mercy commercial was THA BEST!!
5356,Tv6AsFuBbUk,shorts scream : GAAAAAAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
5357,Tv6AsFuBbUk,"“ i’m gonna pick a shitty outfit for you “ 
“Well……… Don’t do that” 😂"
5358,Tv6AsFuBbUk,"“ i’m gonna pick a shitty outfit for you “

5363,qYnloYaeQA8,"Sucks, because all of Will's introspectiveness and insight went out the window the day he got up and didn't use any of his own words in that moment, and abused Chris Rock on stage"
5364,qYnloYaeQA8,His father should be paying him for the rest of his damned life what a piece of shi*t He never should have forgiven him! Just because someone has blood related doesn't mean they are family and his father is not his family
5365,qYnloYaeQA8,comment of support belated =)
5366,qYnloYaeQA8,"Ok guys, I'm starting my mile today."
5367,qYnloYaeQA8,"Dear Ammar, this speaks to your feelings about your jump. I have found you recently and watched countless of your productions. Sadly a less than thrilling experience was the top image in my head. 

What I saw when you jumped was beauty and strength. Will’s form did not come close to matching yours. Your outstretched arms and entire body spoke of art in action. I am sure this is of no. Comfort to you in the sad place your heart is in regarding your Father, family and country. Those big answers often take a lifetime to understand and fully process. It was so with my own Father. I am glad you are in the world doing what is helping so many people in countless places. It’s a work of love. It’s Gods work bringing all of us together. I have love for the wonderful man you are. My big dream for you is to be rolling in love, to be dripping in it as if it were a storm, to take it in with every breath of your life. I believe in miracles, I saw one in my own Father who was an enormous source of fear turn into an expressive loving man. Keep the faith Ammar. You make miracles happen all the time. It will be your turn one day. I hope it is soon. Love and know you are so loved. I’m imagining your sparkling eyes so full of life and joy. I’m thinking of the day your biggest dream comes true❣️"
5368,qYnloYaeQA8,Keep yes thoery out ya movie
5369,qYnloYaeQA8,Ok but is anyone going to talk about Amman saying a heli jump doesn’t challenge him? :D
5370,qYnloYaeQA8,I m so behind in vid.its awsome more and more hope i will be i the future challenges
5371,qYnloYaeQA8,233
5372,qYnloYaeQA8,When you realize you don’t need Will Smith. Just your self ❤️👌🏾
5373,qYnloYaeQA8,Thanks Ammar! That went in good time bud
5374,qYnloYaeQA8,Edits was awesome
5375,qYnloYaeQA8,Crybaby bitch this was clickbait you were insinuating Will Smith did something wrong
5376,qYnloYaeQA8,I am binge watching yes theory vids to help me get through life.
5377,qYnloYaeQA8,This time is so timely. I am currently on the lowest moment of my life. I have been trying to get up for a month. I wasn't able to do so today. I hope I can do it tomorrow.
5378,qYnloYaeQA8,Woaw :)
5379,qYnloYaeQA8,you're helping me a lot rn.. thanks guys

It also heartwarming to see that you've spent some time in my home city of Budapest. I wish I knew you were there at the time. <3"
5449,j-CohfDplks,What a great experience.
5450,j-CohfDplks,"I love this channel and their good vibes… but I couldn’t help thinking that this would be a great way to get a bunch of people together and brainwash them into a cult. 😶 Be careful, everyone. I wish there weren’t so many bad people out there, but there are."

5466,1hYCv24Ed3M,Belated comment of support! Raza =)
5467,1hYCv24Ed3M,I love Will Smith! I grew up watching everything he was in and I even had his CD! He is one of my favorite actors. You guys are so lucky!

5477,1hYCv24Ed3M,No matter what happened. Even after the slap heard around the world Will Smith is still the man.  I grew up watching Fresh Prince. The bad boys movies are some of my favorites.
5478,1hYCv24Ed3M,A clip of Jada caring about Will; four years sounds about right
5479,1hYCv24Ed3M,did you dare Will Smith to slap Chris Rock?
5480,1hYCv24Ed3M,I'm here from the future.. Will Smith smacked Chris Rock and nobody loves him now lol

5492,lofGdqwuRnM,"My wife and I never got a honeymoon either... We found out she was pregnant as I prepared to go to Teachers College and we had only been together for 5 months. We committed to each other and got married, and 11 years later we now have 3 kids. We tried to win a honeymoon by competing on Four Weddings Canada, but came in last place lol. Having the kids and not having had a lot of career success, we've just never had time or money. We'd welcome a number of extra wheels in return for investment lol!"
5493,lofGdqwuRnM,"Peter: *hits Jill in the shoulder by accident*
OH dear! How can I make this up to you?!

5603,EfUypVghYmo,Derin did better than Thomas at stand up comedy. ! He has that way of speaking that most comedians have.
5604,EfUypVghYmo,I watch like every yes theory video and I haven’t seen this one and it was randomly suggested to me just now and in September I stayed In Toronto for 2 weeks and they were walking in front of the condo building I was staying in and the hot dog stand I was going to frequently and It’s crazy to me that we walked in some of the same places 🤣 I know it’s not that big of a deal but I wish that this video was filmed in September so I could of met y’all
5605,EfUypVghYmo,so cute!
5606,EfUypVghYmo,"Guys, how about supporting Turkey after the earthquake? Did you hear from Derin, is he OK, the family?"
5607,EfUypVghYmo,Derin was a really good sport

5616,EfUypVghYmo,"Whoaa thank you so much for this update and for making this reunion an eventful one. 😭💕 We freakin missed Der-bear so much, even though I've just finished binge-watching your videos up until his last one before this. Really happy to see him happy and excited to do crazy stuff again with you guys. 🥺🤍 He also seemed more confident and definitely less scared of heights and doing crazy/uncomfortable stuff. Love seeing that! 💖"
5617,EfUypVghYmo,Derin shouting at the security checkpoint was hilarious
5618,EfUypVghYmo,Bring Matt also back!!🙂
5619,EfUypVghYmo,Wish it all wasn't planned. 10:45 He said no to a question!
5620,EfUypVghYmo,Find ich gut! Wenigstens für alle denen die Haare sowieso ausgehen!Dann fühlen sie sich nicht so alleine!

5636,OG0_psIy4eo,Kendrick Lamar is actually a huge ass.... one time he invited a white fan on stage to sing a part that had the n word in it and when she sang it he made the whole crowd turn on her. I love yes theory and used to love Kendrick.... I’m sorry but I have to say this he isn’t a good person
5637,OG0_psIy4eo,This is what I love to see. Cool talented people who work together
5638,OG0_psIy4eo,Good vibe.

5642,2pJltFDLvPY,Did you do somethig with Anthony?
5643,2pJltFDLvPY,anddd ladies and gentleman we the viewers took them sskydyiving
5644,2pJltFDLvPY,I’m going skydiving tomorrow with my family… had to come back to this gem of a video 🙏🙏🙏
5645,2pJltFDLvPY,"I've been skydiving once, as well. The fear kicks in most when the plane is getting to the height it should be at. Once the doors open and you know there's no way back, the fear stabilizes. It was an awesome experience, although the turning  with the parachute open made me a bit nausseous, I'd do it again. The peace and quite up in the sky, with a view as far as that, it's amazing."
5646,2pJltFDLvPY,It iz amazing
5647,2pJltFDLvPY,"That was so awesome, you guys got the driver and the car pull passenger! That looked so fun! ❤"
5648,2pJltFDLvPY,So proud of you Alexis! Freaking awesome!!!
5649,2pJltFDLvPY,"Oh man, you all make me cry on EVERY episode! Tears of joy, every time!  I am ready to SAY YES!"
5650,2pJltFDLvPY,"Ummmm as someone who is 40 boooooo! I would have said yes, even though the idea is terrifying"
5651,2pJltFDLvPY,Second time going sky diving today was a little nervous but now after watching to im comforted again
5652,2pJltFDLvPY,Ammar's speeches and pitches always gets me.  It gets you deep!
5653,2pJltFDLvPY,Perris was my first parachute jump in 1983. I did a static line jump. Now 40 static lines and one tandem under my belt and still jumping.
5654,2pJltFDLvPY,Happy New Year!! This was awesome :)
5655,2pJltFDLvPY,What’s the song when they jump?
5656,2pJltFDLvPY,"'Black people don't belong in the air men....'😂😂😂  My ancestors laughed so hard, like yeah, girl.  You know what's up!😂😂"
5657,2pJltFDLvPY,I know it's 4 years later but tale Anthony to a speedway and let him drive fast exotic cars..
5658,2pJltFDLvPY,Are we doing age discrimination now? Just teasing you I understand
5659,2pJltFDLvPY,"""black people don't belong in the air"" ""black people don't belong in water"" then what do you do?????"
5660,2pJltFDLvPY,With those suits they look like knockoff Power Rangers 😂
5661,2pJltFDLvPY,"That was so weak! If he knew there was a weight limit and remotely suspected the dude could be close to it, why the hell would he even risk putting him through that by asking? You gotta be obtuse... And that driver chick nailed it: I immediately thought she was going to say something like ""we can jump, but you go ahead and pretend you can fly"", haha. Man, you can't rush a stranger who has never done something like that to do it on the spot. They might say ""yes"" in the moment and get really distressed when they actually are about to do it... and they don't know you... and you are filming them. This episode was really weak. And anyway the chick gave in to peer pressure. Well... whatever. I'd totally say yes and then shit myself before I'm about to jump."
5662,gCB1bAdcQxA,We fixed the international shipping issue. Give it another try. Sorry for the inconvenience!
5663,gCB1bAdcQxA,Yes theory must have great neighbour's!
5664,gCB1bAdcQxA,I wonder how the neighbours feel living next to these guys 🤔😂

5680,gCB1bAdcQxA,"TD was the best lmao he threw the sunglasses, fake caught them and pulled out another pair lmfaooooo"

🇳🇿🇳🇿🐑🐑"
5682,RUkNmLIMzzo,"mix emotions to this content.
Happy,sad and afraid. Happy because I see Thomas how genuine  he is and he is valuing love,care and friendship. Sad because what if it’s our last day on earth so what’s we gonna do? and Afraid because what if we cannot do our dreams before we die. Crazy thoughts but reality. 

You are so lucky Thomas to have Matt, Ammar and the rest to your life. Long Live. safe travels always to the team. God Bless…"
5683,RUkNmLIMzzo,Omg the dinner looked soooo good!
5684,RUkNmLIMzzo,Love this one so much
5685,RUkNmLIMzzo,I’d give anything to surf.
5686,RUkNmLIMzzo,Thank you for sharing such a powerful day with the Yes Fam!!
5687,RUkNmLIMzzo,"I mean if I had 24 hours to live it would be good food with family, pretty simple, its what a lot of us do everyday, we aint really forgetting that..."
5688,RUkNmLIMzzo,Loved that song by shoffy when you guys were surfing!
5689,RUkNmLIMzzo,wait was it actually his last 24 hours?

5694,RUkNmLIMzzo,
5695,RUkNmLIMzzo,This video is goated. Dancing in public like no one is watching is in my bucket list
5696,RUkNmLIMzzo,"The amazing part of this video is, that you actually didn't really do anything different than usually, which shows that you are alreadyliving life to your fullest."
5697,RUkNmLIMzzo,"Yo, if I had 24 hours to kick the bucket, fuck it
I'd probably eat some fried chicken and drink a Nantucket…."
5698,RUkNmLIMzzo,Making me proud to be a human
5699,RUkNmLIMzzo,This episode was REAALLL. Thank you.
5700,RUkNmLIMzzo,"This definitely be my favorite video. The friendship you forge is just genuine, I dream of having one. You're not afraid of being vulnerable to one another, it shows your values. Truly, vulnerability builds community. The video is moving and thought-provoking, I tear up on the part where the delivery guy said it was the first time that someone has been so kind to him. It speaks so much volume. And your message is clear, to live life as if it's the last, do the things that make you fully alive and show to people you love how grateful you are to have them. Thank you, Yes Theory. Continue what you do, people like me is evidence that what you do impacts not just the people who watched this 3 years ago, but to now and the future, as long as you exist. To more ""yeses"" and discomforts!"
5701,RUkNmLIMzzo,I feel like this is so unrealistic considering you're not dying.

5742,DCNXye4DcWw,HEYALL! Matt writes an epic 1-minute newsletter every Friday and has been getting so much incredible feedback on it. If you wanna join our community of newsletter readers check it out here: http://yestheory.com/newsletter
5743,DCNXye4DcWw,It's can sorta compare to contractions but if you put them in your no no spot you could feel the delivery part! 😂
5744,DCNXye4DcWw,If he can smile it isnt painful enough! 😅
5745,DCNXye4DcWw,"giving birth is a joke
sbd ever had a kidney stone ?"
5746,DCNXye4DcWw,youre only supposed to give one finger not your whole hand cause shell break your hand squeezing during labor
5747,DCNXye4DcWw,This is great for guys to feel the pain of a womans hardship in labor😊
5748,DCNXye4DcWw,*Trans man watching like: you dare underestimate me*
5749,DCNXye4DcWw,hello yes fam !!!!!!!!!!!
5750,DCNXye4DcWw,"It's always fun to watch these and nice to see guys appreciate their moms and other women who have given birth. However, this isn't the same experience. Labor pain is productive, not destructive like an injury (unless there's also something going wrong at the same time), and this device can't account for that. It also can't reproduce the hormonal feedback loop that lets you get through birth, often with less or even minimal pain depending on pain tolerance and how you've trained/practiced to work with--not against--your body to get through it. So if anybody was more scared of pregnancy and birth after this, hopefully the info in my comment helps."
5751,DCNXye4DcWw,"child birth is not, technically, the most painful thing, it's kidney stones"
5752,DCNXye4DcWw,*Seek Discomfort* lol😂
5753,DCNXye4DcWw,"Gosh, I did do this once 19.5 years ago …but I have forgotten the pain… the brilliance of the brain & body working together.
However, watching Matt laugh suggests the dial was not nearly high enough!!
🇳🇿🇳🇿🐑🐑NZ"
5754,DCNXye4DcWw,TD is an absolute beast.
5755,DCNXye4DcWw,"I can't believe I did this to my poor mother. Absolutely never having kids. Imagine doing that for an entire fucking day, sometimes longer."
5756,DCNXye4DcWw,This should be a requirement for every teenager when they hit puberty!
5757,DCNXye4DcWw,The nurse probably enjoyed that her husband was one of the people that she was Simulating labour to
5758,DCNXye4DcWw,212 🤣😂😍
5759,DCNXye4DcWw,I'd also like to add that now you also know what it feels like for people with bad period cramps that they have to work through every single month
5760,DCNXye4DcWw,"3:53  
Why you shouldn't have kids"
5761,DCNXye4DcWw,How the hell he not feel anything

5793,lI5T2S63sms,"The thought of SEEK DISCOMFORT, urges me to take an action. It keeps telling me that there's more to what was and is. Sometimes it's not just the convenience that led us astray from focusing to what really matters but how we deal with certain dilemmas in ourlives, are we even facing them or are we only telescoping ahead yet never taking a step forward. Nesting in the comfort zone and neglecting the flight we ought to take prevent us from soaring for the things which really meant for us. Many of us are having less of everything because we miss the greater portion, outside certain discomforts await and we will no longer escape them but seek them and once we find them, we will face them because we want not to miss any opportunity to experience new things and be in the position of purpose which God has called us. You just have to GO OUTSIDE.

I am a 70 year old, very poor Opa, and I go on holidays without any money, without anything.  It is a very tough challenge for me, not being young anymore, with some serious health issues.

5863,e-GbaNLgM18,"There's a ton of videos of people that ran a marathon without training and that's all nice, now what I wanted to see is the day following the race. If videos are true, these people are probably not able to stand the next day."
5864,e-GbaNLgM18,amazing effort loved watching your journey my friend !

5869,e-GbaNLgM18,This weekend I'm running my first half marathon in Lyon and rewatching this video just gave me that extra push I needed!
5870,e-GbaNLgM18,Tomorrow I start the Chicago Marathon. Did I train? No. But we are going for it.
5871,e-GbaNLgM18,running an unofficial marathon tommorow. At my local park. Have barley trained. Going to run on pure motivation.
5872,e-GbaNLgM18,"Recommended reading :
« What I Talk About When I Talk About Running » by Haruki Murakami"
5873,e-GbaNLgM18,Walking doesn't count lol
5874,e-GbaNLgM18,"Today I did a marathon without training and got one minute more than Ammar, my name is Ammar too btw😂"
5875,e-GbaNLgM18,So you said you’re struggling with procrastination and instead of really train for months to show you can achieve something like a marathon and beat your procrastination you stumbled into a marathon with no training at all and sell it as a win 😅 that’s stupid and not healthy at all. It just generates views and clicks.
5876,e-GbaNLgM18,"It's possible, but can finish very bad (even death)"
5877,e-GbaNLgM18,I am crying!! Congrats! I am running my first marathon tomorrow and I did not finish my training so I am inspired to run and finish it after watching this!
5878,e-GbaNLgM18,Thanks for the inspo. running a marathon tomorrow with one month of training!
5879,e-GbaNLgM18,No such thing as depression. It's western made up BS

5902,ZMI-R5y80_M,the opposite of stanger danger lol
5903,ZMI-R5y80_M,"Why is, ""Thomas from Yes Theory loves you"" not in your merch store as a shirt, etc.? Lol"
5904,ZMI-R5y80_M,The Kenyan in me would be like 'No you dont! PWA HAHAHAAA!'  🏃‍♀🏃‍♀🏃‍♀🏃‍♀🏃‍♀
5905,ZMI-R5y80_M,He looks like Ryan Gosling. 
5906,ZMI-R5y80_M,That was awesome.
5907,ZMI-R5y80_M,"Challenging people watching this is an awesome way to spread love all over the world!! I wonder how many people actually did it 🤔. I know I will not do it! I'm a swede living in Sweden with other swedes. I can totally relate to Thomas! I'll be uncomfortable and I will most definitely make my fellow swedes extremely uncomfortable. We don't take the words ""I love you"" lightly at all. We rarely say ""jag älskar dej"" unless we actually really mean it!! Alot of people here have never ever heard these words directed towards them. Now I'm sad. And I feel guilty. Maybe I can gather the courage and tell at least one..."
5908,ZMI-R5y80_M,l love you all guys. thanku for making my day better. 😇😊
5909,ZMI-R5y80_M,"Hellooooo you there stranger , I am from Chicago I looove  💖💞❤️💖💚💝💕💗💜💓💙💓you"
5910,ZMI-R5y80_M,"Back when this video came out I was so inspired that I spent three days holding a sign on the corner of a very busy intersection. The sign read ""Free Compliments or Hugs."" And though I tried to compliment everyone, many people chose the hug. I was very out of my comfort zone, but it was an experience that will not only never be matched, but possibly the most moving, humbling, and happiest thing I've ever done. Say Yes more often. Seek Discomfort, as you might (hopefully) find it much more pleasing than expected. Even if not, the positive outcomes will always outweigh the negative. Try something different, and push the boundaries of normalcy. This is now the motto for my life. ""Push The Boundaries Of Normalcy"""
5911,ZMI-R5y80_M,i'm not afraid to say every one every where i love you
5912,ZMI-R5y80_M,"I have a question……The guy just walked away😭😭😭😂😂😂I am sorry, but it's so funny😁😁"
5913,ZMI-R5y80_M,Are guests allso strangers? Because I belief with our guests it will be easy to do!
5914,ZMI-R5y80_M,❤❤❤
5915,ZMI-R5y80_M,"This experiment is not for Bangladesh. Too complecated to tell someone that ""I love you"". You might get a slap instantly."

5921,ZMI-R5y80_M,I love U
5922,oYe-QM8ZimI,"Hi everyone! This is Thomas, super strange for me to put up something like this for the world to see but if this can somehow inspire some of you who might be closed off like I once was.. Then it's worth it. Much love to you all!"
5923,oYe-QM8ZimI,"OMG so much pressure. But that's Thomas, he's intense and can't help it. Amazing person but too weird for this world. Also, this vid reminded me of ... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPrpGCcFtt4"
5924,oYe-QM8ZimI,"She's seems opposite of Thomas judgmental.... lol but thomas is judgemental for judging himself wrong when someone refused him . Thomas seems full of love..maybe for others. She didn't seem full of love. 
She seems like amma not that amma is judgemental  but the male version of him, I think thomas needs 2 not be attached to anyone else .....males to find his one and truely. U cnt just like someone because u cn express urself to them, that's express 2 nowhere."
5925,oYe-QM8ZimI,I've never seen someone so... awkward but not it a bad way but then again non of my friends are in relationships so I'm not sure anyway they seemed cute together
5926,oYe-QM8ZimI,We definitely need an update on this please
5927,oYe-QM8ZimI,its like thomas win the lottery on this girl so beautiful😍
5928,oYe-QM8ZimI,Aww cool

5930,oYe-QM8ZimI,"Wait, that's Lana Blakely"
5931,oYe-QM8ZimI,"That’s Lana! Interesting to see this, especially because I’ve watched these two separately for years and I’m only just seeing this video."
5932,oYe-QM8ZimI,damn Ive never felt more single in my life then after watching this
5933,oYe-QM8ZimI,La meuf est cool!!! J'espère que ça marche entre vous. Salut depuis le Togo 🇹🇬
5934,oYe-QM8ZimI,I hope they are still together
5935,oYe-QM8ZimI,the french are really wierd man ... like who tf looked at a snail and thought lets eat this like who came up with the idea ....
5936,oYe-QM8ZimI,Godammit where can I get myself a suavecito man like Thomas
5937,oYe-QM8ZimI,8:24 fun fact: did u know that its illegal to film eiffel towers lights :D
5938,oYe-QM8ZimI,💚Happy for you.  I just cannot do it again💔
5939,oYe-QM8ZimI,Ngl I've yet to meet a girl who would say no to a paid trip to Paris lmao
5940,oYe-QM8ZimI,"Its my dream to roam in paris with my girlfriend, in spite of the fact that i dont have and never had any girlfriend :P"
5941,oYe-QM8ZimI,Thomas is a typical Cancer♋️

5949,mgXc47nzjHk,yes theory mini
5950,mgXc47nzjHk,"Video idea: Find this kid again, give him the same concept of 24h with a limited amount of money and see what he would like and choose to do with it. ❤ (Also go deep into his changes through the years , and how that day 5 years ago changed his way of thinking)."
5951,mgXc47nzjHk,loved the gangsta limo montage
5952,mgXc47nzjHk,"sooo fucking cute that he gave away the rest of it, what a sweet kid"
5953,mgXc47nzjHk,Pretty clever little dude.

5961,mgXc47nzjHk,"bruh how a 6 year old richer than me i only have a few cents and he's over here balling with $1,000. at least he was having fun with the money and using some of it to give it to people that need it more."

5964,thqHyyUaI-Y,"It took my five years, but yesterday I jumped off the bridge to nowhere, after being originally inspired by this video"
5965,thqHyyUaI-Y,"It looks like they could hit the bridge coming up. The 2 times I noticed it, they just barely missed it. Maybe it was the pov."
5966,thqHyyUaI-Y,"They seem to get so close to hitting the bridge on that first bounce back up, that seems more off-putting than the actual jump/drop lol"
5967,thqHyyUaI-Y,thomas my husband
5968,thqHyyUaI-Y,Thomas in the shark costume just kills me 😂
5969,thqHyyUaI-Y,is anyone gonna mention the lighter and doobie on the table at the beginning? haha awesome!

5971,thqHyyUaI-Y,im really happy to see a bungee cord. i was hoping it was either that or water.
5972,thqHyyUaI-Y,8:01 they came sooo fucking close to the bridge. not cool

5976,thqHyyUaI-Y,anyone know what the song is at the end?
5977,thqHyyUaI-Y,I couldn't stop smiling

6022,qbA42wQoWAs,The only reason these guys haven't been murdered or robbed is because they have a YouTube channel with a camera on the criminals that they've ultimately already met and led into their home😅

6029,qbA42wQoWAs,"I've been binge watching Yes Theory videos from the oldest one, for almost 2 weeks now, and I still have a lot to catch up. I'm a kind of person who's very lazy (haha 😅), has a lot of fears (such as heights and talking to strangers), and is an introvert & shy person. But watching your videos make me feel like I think I can say yes for a free helicopter ride with a stranger (as long as he looks trustworthy and has camera, of course 😂)."
6030,qbA42wQoWAs,Please Let People Laugh.

It was a blessing. I have actually a few stories like that where I got supported in my darkest moments. there are always ways to go when you think it doesn't work anymore. Super grateful for all the love from people I had over the last 4 years. Thanks for your videos. It really motivates even more to seek discomfort. It is my favorite to discover life."

6149,rkF1fXvjYeU,Blacklight ink - would have made it invisible (for the most part).
6150,rkF1fXvjYeU,matt definitely pulled that blond girl 😂
6151,rkF1fXvjYeU,matt smoothly holds her hand 😂
6152,rkF1fXvjYeU,"i read the title and i was in my mind like this: if someone stranger come and ask me to get matching tattoos, i would say instantly yes, because i think that if u get tattoo, there has to be reason, back story or memory to get because its on your skin rest of your life and in  this case there would be back story to have it:D"
6153,rkF1fXvjYeU,I mean if he was paying for it and I got to choose what it was I'd do it lmao
6154,rkF1fXvjYeU,And now all the familiar demons and bloodline curses can move between all of them freely..well done
6155,rkF1fXvjYeU,I didn't know you got matching tattoos with someone I did this with my friend and commented on other vids the same as yes theory and seek discomfort
6156,rkF1fXvjYeU,but a stranger is the best person to get a matching tattoo with
6157,rkF1fXvjYeU,1:00 so you wanna get married and then we can get the tattoos?

6174,J494R_Xeyys,"She's amazing!
I was 20 when I started work in elderly care. I knew nothing! 
My first client would be a 90 year old gentleman, living alone, that was all I knew.

Greener than grass I walked up to the house, rang the doorbell....nothing happend/
As I walked to the back of the house I could see a ladder 2 stories high against the building.

My client was on top of it cleaning the gutters.
As he came down he told me where I could find all the things I needed and excused himself, he had to take his elderly neighbour to the doctorsoffice, ""at her age she is not able to do so herself"" He was back in 10 minutes or so.

As we sat down for some tea a couple of hours later he told me that old lady was 72...he was nearly 20 years older than her😅

This man tought me valuable lesson that day, you are just as old as you believe you are, age is but a number."
6175,J494R_Xeyys,So Humble!!!!✨✨
6176,J494R_Xeyys,"This. Oh, my heart. Thank you for doing this and sharing the Wish of a Lifetime organization with us viewers! Definitely going to look into volunteering with this group!"
6177,J494R_Xeyys,This video hits hard for me because my biggest fear in life is getting to Ellie’s age without accomplishing at least some of my dreams.
6178,J494R_Xeyys,Hello Tomas i am from India i think it is to late to comment but my grandmother never meet any weight people if you are down you can come to India my joint family
6179,J494R_Xeyys,"My grandmother passed away back in 2019 and her final wish was to ride a horse again. Unfortunately, time was too short, so I would love to ride with you guys in her honor. 

What you guys did for Ellie was absolutely beautiful. Thank you for not forgetting about the generations that came before us. You are all truly amazing❤"

6264,nsxxEsp9AsE,"Do you call all dogs “puppies?”
Do you like piña coladas?
Do you ever pick your nose when you think nobody is watching?
Have you ever worn underwear two days in a row?
Have you ever lied about having seen a movie?
Do you ever talk to yourself?
Do you ever talk to your pets?
Do you call cats kitty kitty or pussy pussy?
Do you do the finger test before oral?
Have you ever measured your ding dong?
When did you lose your virginity?"

6300,53WxatM5jss,love this channel your energy helps when am feeling down and makes me want to out of my comfort zone.  How about u ask some strangers to explore a volcano
6301,53WxatM5jss,You don't need a passport to come back to the US by car. Drivers license does it!
6302,Wiaef1jioqQ,"Hey guys, really sorry we haven't been responding to comments lately. We've been busy planning and filming bigger and better videos. We read everything you guys say though and we're frankly so humbled and blessed to have the most positive family on all of youtube. Thank you so much for all of your love <3"
6303,Wiaef1jioqQ,Imagine the police or responsibles of the city decide that the catacombs are dangerous and that all entrances should be closed and they close them while you are in
6304,Wiaef1jioqQ,These skeletons actually shows signs that they were cooked at a very high temperature. Just another lost story of a lost civilization. Perhaps a recent reset. Fire more intense than required to boil. Water was used on the bones. We don’t know the real history. But there are secrets in the world within the architecture that hold clues to many mysteries.
6305,Wiaef1jioqQ,Isnt this the same enterence from As above so below?
6306,Wiaef1jioqQ,Y'all should have watched beneath the day before this excursion
6307,Wiaef1jioqQ,"when they dug up everyone, if there were rings or other valuables what did they do with them?"
6308,Wiaef1jioqQ,"It said something about some skulls... ???

7,000,000 of them. I didn't see one !@#$ing skull.

Still gave a thumbs up."
6309,Wiaef1jioqQ,"Wait, did they enter at the exact same place the characters entered at the movie ""As above so below""??"
6310,Wiaef1jioqQ,i will never go through places like this without a gun !
6311,Wiaef1jioqQ,As below so above
6312,Wiaef1jioqQ,It's like totally away from human lives. Wishes to explore one day.
6313,Wiaef1jioqQ,I would hate this
6314,Wiaef1jioqQ,"I never knew where the catacombs were, but I have a book about them. The christians would hide from the Romans in the tunnels, sometimes even living in them. That ""movie theater""? Probably a church gathering spot."
6315,Wiaef1jioqQ,I wonder if they've ever done any DNA testing on the remains? If they could extract any that is... That would definitely be interesting 🤔😁
6316,Wiaef1jioqQ,Was have a nightmare of being concept failed into a tunnel then eaten by inhabitants
6317,Wiaef1jioqQ,💚
6318,Wiaef1jioqQ,"OMG, while I love the idea of exploring underground cities, I experienced so much anxiety watching this!"
6319,Wiaef1jioqQ,The joker impression 💥
6320,Wiaef1jioqQ,I love Paris I went there and went underground and saw the bones...
6321,Wiaef1jioqQ,I can’t believe it thank you guys did that that is crazy Go crazy though that doubles love it

6326,s8gCHq_7rsQ,"Is alright even when it's not"" . Beautifully said! I love this channel so much, I wonder why it got stuck with no new videos uploaded..."
6327,s8gCHq_7rsQ,I like hearing about people who aren't comfortable talking to people yet somehow do acts well which require such things.

6331,s8gCHq_7rsQ,At 2:28 is the unus annus theme lol
6332,s8gCHq_7rsQ,In the middle of a relapse- this hits.
6333,s8gCHq_7rsQ,"Why, as an alcoholic and already drunk as I am every night, want me to drink even more? I don't understand it."
6334,s8gCHq_7rsQ,"Pete where ever you are man stay strong. I’ve been an alcoholic for more years than I can remember of my 33 on this planet and finally after realizing how close I was to death that I needed to choose life. I too struggled with crippling anxiety and panic attacks from an early age. They got so bad I developed dissociative identity disorder, I would literally forget who I was, where I was, everything; my heart would race and beat irregularly, it happened for years for hours every day to the point that I wanted to commit suicide. I used to get up smack in the middle of class when they’d hit in school and sprint laps in the halls. I went to dozens of therapists etc Finally at one therapy session I kept saying I wanted to feel normal, I didn’t want to feel crazy anymore. My therapist just looked at me and in a cliche but so effective way said, “what is normal, there’s no such thing, embrace your crazy and you’ll soon realize that you’re not crazy at all” Saved my life, stay strong man, and beautiful Music I’m definitely buying your album! - Love over fear..."
6335,s8gCHq_7rsQ,I really love this kind of true story documentation video. It always gives me goosebumps.
6336,s8gCHq_7rsQ,wow i basically lived this dudes life without doing music. for like 3 years straight. so glad i got out of that habit.
6337,s8gCHq_7rsQ,"Am i the only one who watched almost all the videos twice, thrice etc. from northeast India."
6338,s8gCHq_7rsQ,This is the second artist/group that Yes Theory has introduced to me and they're both amazing. The first group was '49th Parallel'
6339,s8gCHq_7rsQ,"i have skipped over watching this video for awhile and finally i just decided to watch it, and oh my gosh. i love this, i love this song. broke right through me. i needed to hear this. possibly my new favorite artist."
6340,s8gCHq_7rsQ,"and there's me sitting here sipping on a can of Dark Fruits... 
Love these sorts of videos guys, more please. :)"
6341,s8gCHq_7rsQ,Very brave of him to share and find a way to navigate past his demons

6432,aXGsieBZ7YY,It’s videos like this that make me get up and go to work everyday just hoping Ammar will intercept me on the way there and toss me out of a plane.
6433,aXGsieBZ7YY,"I did my first tandem a couple months ago. Like the guy said ""I want to do this every day for the rest of my life"" is 100% true. I'm signing up for AFF classes soon. I'm willing to bet that guy is probably jumping again"

Like think about the humans around you and a little less about yourself.
6511,Zdi0lB7q0vc,Finnish people are so chill lol
6512,Zdi0lB7q0vc,"Don't gonna say nothing more then try to go without camera group and don't tell u have a bet with your friend's and u gonna find u self in totally difrend situacion.. no food,no money,no shelter !!"
6513,Zdi0lB7q0vc,"I'm a Finn, and this embarrassed me!! Seemed like they didn't care but It's true that if someone speaks english to us in the streets, most people will freak out/freeze right there. I know there's so many people who would give everything to you and you'd have to ask no one else. Also Helsinki is the shittiest place in finland for this kind of challenge. But I'm glad you survived 😅😅"
6514,Zdi0lB7q0vc,Its weird how this video is so short
6515,Zdi0lB7q0vc,How very convenient! Some random stranger just hands you 10 Euros to buy food! Doesn't seem like a set up at all.
6516,Zdi0lB7q0vc,"Why not come to Yemen lol
It would be one hell of a challenge 😂😂😂"
6517,Zdi0lB7q0vc,I challenge the Yes family to try a No Money challenge in one of the worlds most beautiful countries - Botswana! 🇧🇼
6518,Zdi0lB7q0vc,"you should come to finland in the summer it look awesome and all those bars, cafes etc outside is very nice helsinki is a summer city. but if you want to come visit in the winter you should go to lapland to see reindeer, northern lights and other stuff."
6519,Zdi0lB7q0vc,"Ok I just have to say, I'm the mother of a 35 year old man who all of you remind me of. I've totally gotten into yes theory over the last few months. I was home with a badly broken arm and bored out of my mind and you guys made it so much easier. Not to mention you gave me a new faith in a younger generation. Your Love of other cultures , you're unlimited curiosity, and your longing to push yourself outside your comfort zone is just amazing to me and again I say you remind me so much of my son. He loves all of that you guys could be best friends for sure. Anyways I wish you all well I feel like you're my children I watch over you on on the videos and I honestly feel like I know you so good luck in your future ventures and just know that there's a 55-year-old woman out here that finds you just as interesting and just as wonderful as your peers. You guys are amazing."
6520,Zdi0lB7q0vc,Very strange abrupt end
6521,Zdi0lB7q0vc,Why dont you just fast for the day!? Easy to go a day w/o food..
6522,CrKWjkGKcfk,"well all nice an everything, but the ‚reversing my brain tumor naturally‘ is cap. Brutal cap."
6523,CrKWjkGKcfk,we shouldn’t be scared of the word fat
6524,CrKWjkGKcfk,God damn rich people are so ABLE to do amazing things! Chase those dreams because you don’t HAVE to spend your day chasing a pay check. SOOOOO inspiring. Tell me how you did this living paycheck to paycheck. Happy for you but you’re soooo disconnected.

6530,CrKWjkGKcfk,"If you are reading this and you recognize some of these thoughts, go to therapy. Binge eating disorder is a serious condition, and not everyone has the circumstance set up like this person. That is not to diminish his success at all. But take it seriously. Some people do not survive rock bottom. Seek therapy."
6531,CrKWjkGKcfk,Did he ever do an iron man?
6532,CrKWjkGKcfk,Im sorry but this guy is full of shit. He says he won grammys and has songs with 8 millions views or whatever but there are 0 songs of him on the internet
6533,CrKWjkGKcfk,"I push myself every day, people still don't understand why. There is something just being out there, and walking or riding my bike with nature. It's 1% better than I was yesterday doing the best I can, and staying positive. Great Job!! I lost weight too as my mom calls it ""whole person"""
6534,CrKWjkGKcfk,"Definitely speaks to me deeply. Been overweight most of my life, going to be 36 soon and I weight 470. Don't like living this way, plus the fear of failure following my dreams. I feel I need a reset in my mind to become that person I want to be, instead of being on cruise control not enjoying life, but it's been a struggle to get there on my own."
6535,CrKWjkGKcfk,This guy is a machine he is amazing
6536,CrKWjkGKcfk,charlie is starting this journey again while helping other people in his dream machine with dream team
6537,CrKWjkGKcfk,"Don't get me wrong. He has reached his peak happiness i thrive for and i am proud of him, but not all of us are millionaires with the priviledge to change. Try doing this working minimum wages. It's impossible."
6538,CrKWjkGKcfk,When extrovert becomes introvert and then becomes both that inspires children around the world lol

It was a work trip - flying solo.

Plan:
MTL - TORONTO - HONG KONG (approx 15 hours total)

Reality:
MTL - delayed flight to Toronto, missed HK Flight

Best Option Available:
MTL - Toronto (4 hours later)

4 hour layover Toronto
Toronto - London (7 hour flight.... in middle seat....)

18 hour layover in London
London - HK - (13.5 hr flight..... in middle seat....)

I made a friend on the same screwed up flight path and we just hit up the lounges along the way lol

6577,IjjgbU55nJ8,Watching this is so weird nowadays because the Democrats brainwashed people into the covid cult
6578,IjjgbU55nJ8,"Back a few years ago, some college buddies and I decided to take a trip together to New York City in March of all times lol. Our flight was to leave Lexington, Kentucky. We decided to go ahead an go to Lexington and stay with a buddy of ours up there that night, in case it snowed. They were giving a chance of snow. So around 10 or 11PM that night it started to snow. So we went to bed not thinking much of it, we woke up with about 9 inches of snow on the ground. We thought for sure out flight was cancelled. We call our airline and the airport to check, and our flight was still scheduled to depart at 10AM. So we got up left a little early in case there were any issues. We get to the airport and once we got through security they cancelled our flight. So they decided to taxi us to the Cincinnati airport, and there they had between 14-16 inches of snow, but they were still trying to get flights out. So our next flight in Cincinnati was to leave at 1:25PM EST. We got to Cincinnati got through security and guess what? They cancelled our flight. They said they could get us on the next flight which was 7 or 7:30 sometime. That flight was delayed then cancelled. We asked them if we could get a flight in the Newark or JFK as the issue seemed to be with LaGuardia. All flights to LaGuardia seemed to cancel after booking. We finally got on a plane around 10:30PM ESt, but it did not leave at that time, we sit on the tarmac waiting to go through de-icer. We called our hotel throughout the day telling them we would be in but it would be late. So we get to NYC around 1 or 2 AM. We get to our hotel and they had already given our room away. On top of that none of our luggage was there. The company we booked hotel with was able to get us a hotel right up the road, although we had to pay an extra $400. The next day my buddies luggage arrived, mine however did not. Out of the 4 of us only my luggage took longer. It was Wednesday before I got my luggage. We had a good time while in NYC and then came the trip back home. So we got on the plane from LaGuardia on our way home. We had to go to Chicago first. We get in the air from Chicago and started to tell our Stewardess what happened, and I decided to say it, I said at least we got on this plane and headed home. I guess it was a minute after saying that to the Stewardess and my buddies that the Captain came over speaker and announced we would have to return to Chicago as there was a disabled plane on the runway in Lexington, and we do not have enough fuel to continue to circle. So we got back to Chicago, and was able to get a flight going to Cincinnati instead of Lexington as all flights into Lexington were cancelled due to disabled plane on runway. We get to Cincinnati and we try to start looking for a way back home. On the flight into Cincinnati a guy was on his way to Lexington for a training, and he had to get there for training the next morning. He offered to rent a car if one of us would drive it. I said sure. We get to the rental counters, but because it was so late no one was there to rent us a car, so he instead paid for a Cab van to take us to Lexington. Then from Lexington I took him to his hotel. This was our worst travel story, but we had a good time in NYC and we met a new friend in the process, and keep in tough with him still today. Plus we got a free future flight out of it. So all in all, was still fun, and we have a story to share with people, and we talk about it from time to time."

6587,Qm087Cad-WA,"@Yes Theory, please re-attempt to get Elon Musk' photograph to sell to help those kids."
6588,Qm087Cad-WA,"Elon Musk not replying does not even make sense. What? Is he too busy inventing things that he doesn't have time to spare to show love and support for others?! Elon, ur a role model but u broke many hearts with ur no response. U can do better than that. The world would do much better with love rather than inventions."
6589,Qm087Cad-WA,That didn't age well
6590,Qm087Cad-WA,Back when Elon was actually cool
6591,Qm087Cad-WA,"Thomas and Matt pushed way farther than I would have to get into the truck event lol. When they said we don't know who you are, I would have given up, but they just kept pushing until it was easier to just let them in than keep dealing with them 😂"

6606,Cq7DpoLB7dc,Too bad you cant even pronounce the name of the city correctly.
6607,Cq7DpoLB7dc,"Most of the world's problems are because of the Western nations that exploited other countries and started some type of wars there. Either through exploiting resources or a product or simply by leaving a nation after carving it up as a territory for centuries or many decades, thus resulting in heavy stability in those places which lead to civil war.

It's good to see that Communa 13 has recovered. What happened there is simply awful. The past should never be forgotten."
6608,Cq7DpoLB7dc,
6609,Cq7DpoLB7dc,"They make cocaine in Columbia and the UK uses it. London must be the white lines capital of the world at this point. They snort so much cocaine in London that it's ending up in the Thames from people weeing it into the sewer system. It's caused the eels to be hyperactive and not reproduce. Global banking and finance sectors all right there in the city of London. I once met someone who was in that industry there. He had applied for a line of credit for a client and the lender misplaced the decimal. He misappropriated the difference, which was hundreds of thousands and went on a cocaine and hooker binge until the money ran out and he was almost dead. Then when the law and the lender came after him, he argued successfully that they had put his life in danger in providing him the means to buy so much cocaine."
6610,Cq7DpoLB7dc,I love this channel so much!
6611,Cq7DpoLB7dc,"This is very sad. But, amazing job being brave enough to be there."
6612,Cq7DpoLB7dc,Looks beautiful there!!!
6613,Cq7DpoLB7dc,"One of the main reasons i miss Matt in your videos, he was always so genuinely interested to ask locals their stories. Great Spanish and translation also! (A bit annoyed commentsection only mentioned Thomas' Spanish when he was talking with kids only, no offence Thomas xD)."
6614,Cq7DpoLB7dc,stupid idiot.

6632,bv5sOzzA52A,169th woah
6633,bv5sOzzA52A,Some years ago I went to the toilet in the middle of the night and locked the door. The lock stopped working and I couldn't open the door. Ofcourse my phone was in the kitchen and my family was sleeping. They had to get up at like 4am to go to work so I spent the night in the cold ass toilet instead of waking people up.
6634,bv5sOzzA52A,"You guys did more in that damn washroom than I do in a day at my desk, with a full functioning kitchen to use hahahahah fml"

How about some Yes Theory Coffee? No joke, I'd totally love that for a holiday gift.

6645,gOHyy_6Kd2U,Los pepe was not a rival cartel they were elite commandos
6646,gOHyy_6Kd2U,wow i would love to do a home make over...  beatuful property
6647,gOHyy_6Kd2U,What a beautiful location!
6648,gOHyy_6Kd2U,"10,000,000 views on 10,000,000 mansion"
6649,gOHyy_6Kd2U,"a bunch of pusss playin in a notorious place, no history, no pictures of how it looked, basically showing some ruins and then dumb play. It s not worth watching, couldn't even go past minute 5, is useless"
6650,gOHyy_6Kd2U,Reporting
6651,gOHyy_6Kd2U,Why he whispering 😂🤦🏻‍♂️💀
6652,gOHyy_6Kd2U,"If you’re reading this, know that you are worthy of anything you desire. Most times it amazes me greatly how I moved from an average lifestyle to earning over $63k per month, Utter shock is the word. I have understood a lot in the past few years that there are lots of opportunities in the financial market. The only thing is to know where to invest."
6653,gOHyy_6Kd2U,Nuts! $10 mil mansion video with 10 mil views!
6654,gOHyy_6Kd2U,"AFAIK, Los Pepes were *not* a drug cartel. Rather, they were a group of vigilantes who wanted revenge for killed family members etc. There is evidence strongly suggesting they collaborated with some governmental institutions officially going after Pablo Escobar. There is also speculation they might have collaborated with the Cali Cartel but I don't know much about this."
6655,gOHyy_6Kd2U,hi just wanted to say i am sorry you don’t have to forgive me because i do not desever it just don’t go to lunch with treyston he is a jerk like me but alll i want to say is sorry and please don’t be friends with treyston anymore i also don’t want to be your friend anymore because i don’t deserve your friendship anymore after i ran away from you because you should have friends that care about you unlike me
6656,gOHyy_6Kd2U,All that money and nothing to show for it… Empires take years to build and a day to destroy. Sin is so deceitful. The love of money is truly the root of ALL evil.
6657,gOHyy_6Kd2U,"It's a shame,that  beautiful mansions like Pablo Escobar are left abandoned to deteriorate. What a waste."
6658,gOHyy_6Kd2U,"I don't understand how people can turn their brains off to the desecration of unique natural beauty just to climb it. Same thing happened to Uluru in the heart of Australia,there was a climbing support drilled into it but now some people have realised that just because you can do something doesn't make it ok to do it, and that climbing structure has been removed and it is now illegal to climb Uluru, which was disrespectfully named Ayres Rock for many years"
6659,gOHyy_6Kd2U,Escobar has billions hidden off somewhere and I’m pretty sure millions are hidden around that property somewhere but he only knows
6660,gOHyy_6Kd2U,Bueno
6661,gOHyy_6Kd2U,"you respect the ghost towns ,  you respect the locations. BLAH BLAH .. then you PAINT BALL in one... you look like dumb ass kids...  or just admit you dont like Pablo , and you wanted to make fun of his legacy ..."

6699,bzmU8yjb1RM,Binge Watching 👀 2021
6700,bzmU8yjb1RM,This should be called CULTURE SHOCKING A RANDOM FAN as the first interaction in the morning was two famous ppl in underwear asking him who tf he is. Lmao
6701,bzmU8yjb1RM,Can you ever get bored from thes guys
6702,PcQPFzmG3mw,Unsubscribed.
6703,PcQPFzmG3mw,"Proof that not everything you do should be filmed. This was boring, self-indulgent, and just like a bunch of Frat Boys doing alpha male shit boy antics"
6704,PcQPFzmG3mw,Now Logan has over 25million subscribers and still counting. And I'm still waiting for yes theory hit the 10 million subscribers. You guys not gaining any new subscribers most probably you missed the fun cause you went into wrong direction drastically.
6705,PcQPFzmG3mw,The fact hes now in wwe
6706,PcQPFzmG3mw,2023 aprail 6th and i love you ❤
6707,PcQPFzmG3mw,What did I just watch?
6708,PcQPFzmG3mw,Grooooooss
6709,PcQPFzmG3mw,So I had no idea who Logan Paul was. This must be a sign that I’m getting old
6710,PcQPFzmG3mw,so confusing
6711,PcQPFzmG3mw,He a scam
6712,PcQPFzmG3mw,Yes boys should of said NO to this.
6713,PcQPFzmG3mw,Please don’t associate yourselves with… 😑😑😑.
6714,PcQPFzmG3mw,Who is Logan Paul.. I hear that name a lot in videos..
6715,PcQPFzmG3mw,Well todays discomfort just came from watching this video
6716,PcQPFzmG3mw,"Wow, Logan has changed A LOT since this vid. Mad props for personal growth."
6717,PcQPFzmG3mw,We're pretty sure he wants to be roommates 😂
6718,PcQPFzmG3mw,beast
6719,PcQPFzmG3mw,Jesus that dude is creepy af. Just shows that tik tok’d people are what influences
6720,PcQPFzmG3mw,Logan paul?!!
6721,PcQPFzmG3mw,It would be interesting to see Yes Theory w/ Logan Paul today...
6722,okdksGYkHXE,We leave for Finland and then Europe today! We might be organizing a meet up in Paris in early December so let us know if any of you will be there :)
6723,okdksGYkHXE,Nowwww who’s those two beauty’s that yes theory was with in this vid someone help me
6724,okdksGYkHXE,💚
6725,okdksGYkHXE,"Hot take, it’s way easier for girls to approach guys, even in this scenario, than it is the other way around without seeming creepy 😂"
6726,okdksGYkHXE,"I've got tears all over my face, watching Derin and Thomas speaking Spanish is way too much, can't take it 😂😂😂"
6727,okdksGYkHXE,Girls askin for number isnt that difficult compared to guys
6728,okdksGYkHXE,"Just goes to show that the reason why people are single is that they don't put themselves out there. A girl can literally choose a single guy to walk up to and it's practically a guaranteed date, though a coin toss if it'll go anywhere. A guy needs to put in more effort but it still beats scrolling through social media alone."
6729,okdksGYkHXE,164 haha
6730,okdksGYkHXE,"Kind of irresponsible to not bleep out Paulina’s number. 
I mean I just dialed Paulina Paulina Paulina Paulina and hey I’ve got a date now."
6731,okdksGYkHXE,only ammar would tell the employer to pay him if he himself works
6732,okdksGYkHXE,"Guy: When ?
Ammar:me pay you"
6733,okdksGYkHXE,"Man, when he says he feels like he's having a panic attack and the video you watched before this is the one on meditation (where he talks about his anxiety issues over the years)! Hit me in the feels"
6734,okdksGYkHXE,How to love?
6735,okdksGYkHXE,"😆🤣

6736,okdksGYkHXE,You should do this in France!! Men speaking French literally gives me life ♥️♥️♥️ it’s the sexiest thing 🙌🏽
6737,okdksGYkHXE,"02:50 eghh bien, ne olsun 😄"
6738,okdksGYkHXE,😂😂😂😂😂🇩🇴
6739,okdksGYkHXE,Wow que graciosos
6740,okdksGYkHXE,Matt was so smooth hahaha
6741,okdksGYkHXE,That mustache flip had me dying fam.. DYING
6742,GyvRamX1VyA,"Thank for watching guys, please don't try to replicate this on your own :) Peace and love!"
6743,GyvRamX1VyA,imagine everybody did this. 400 inspectors at a theatre🤣
6744,GyvRamX1VyA,"Americans, especially, are they easiest to swindle. As long as you even slightly look or sound like you know what you're doing, you can probably 99% of Americans"
6745,GyvRamX1VyA,"If you carry a clipboard, you can walk through walls. Also helps that you are all good looking white dudes."
6746,GyvRamX1VyA,"God bless yall and down with satan, dont use Gods* name in vain !!!!"
6747,GyvRamX1VyA,Pro tip. Make sure the vests and clothes are a bit used.
6748,GyvRamX1VyA,"its quite a trip to have this video come up after watching your travel episode on Syria ! lol :D .. Thomas , what a growth :D :D"
6749,GyvRamX1VyA,A big camera works wonder too in most places and especially events. Just look busy!
6750,GyvRamX1VyA,They just filmed themselves committing crimes😂😂
6751,GyvRamX1VyA,that high kick at 1:26 was actually insanely impressive
6752,GyvRamX1VyA,An elephant in a yellow vest could get in anywhere.
6753,GyvRamX1VyA,Try walking into Fort Knox with a ladder
6754,GyvRamX1VyA,You’d probably have more success if you said you were there to repair something. Saying you’re there for an inspection is more likely to make people suspicious.
6755,GyvRamX1VyA,well hitman games are just a real life simulation then
6756,GyvRamX1VyA,Mang aing kadieu gara2 nempo na tiktok
6757,GyvRamX1VyA,"I feel like all of their content is so wholesome in a strange way. Love watching you guys, you make my day better!"
6758,GyvRamX1VyA,Thank you for your service.
6759,GyvRamX1VyA,As a big guy..i get in places with my all black security shirt 😊😊😊
6760,GyvRamX1VyA,can i sneak into coldplay concert ? lets see
6761,GyvRamX1VyA,GAME ON BITCH!!!!🤣🤣🤣
6762,bXUcnFuvqcE,We're heading to Europe in one week and will be there for one month. Let us know if you have ideas of where we should go and do out there!!
6763,bXUcnFuvqcE,Why did he escape? If he's the one who built the prison and that it was so great there. Why escape?
6764,bXUcnFuvqcE,"Colombians talk a load of crap just like Mexicans. Lmao.
This is all BS. Cool video though"
6765,bXUcnFuvqcE,5:10 bruv thats where those dudes were cooked after stealing from Escobar
6766,bXUcnFuvqcE,Watching this after watching Narcos
6767,bXUcnFuvqcE,He has so much money that he has to hire people who can mark on the map where he has burried his money
6768,bXUcnFuvqcE,"Is it a proud thing to write ""revealed by ex drug dealer"" in the title of video? This is complete bullshit. That area is already a tourist place now and open for anyone to visit and see. No one person can randomly go there and say i am revealing it when it's already a open place"
6769,bXUcnFuvqcE,He has another son that no one knew about during the 1980’s when he lived in Miami on and off.
6770,bXUcnFuvqcE,"He could be a old aging man still in a American prison if he chose a different route. 
Good video!! A linger version would be cool."
6771,bXUcnFuvqcE,El patron🫡
6772,bXUcnFuvqcE,"Crazy how all of these events, was just 30 years ago"
6773,bXUcnFuvqcE,"""and that's when ii believe , he shot himself"""
6774,bXUcnFuvqcE,they never found stippling on pablos head or anywhere so they ruled out it being a suicide
6775,bXUcnFuvqcE,But how did he get away with killing in his own prison...?
6776,bXUcnFuvqcE,oi
6777,bXUcnFuvqcE,The way I used to watch this religiou
6778,bXUcnFuvqcE,If he stayed alive they would have rot him in jail.but the guy was clever he killed himself rather than to be killed in jail.👏 May God bless you 🙏 what a man 🙏
6779,bXUcnFuvqcE,"I visited that exact spot in Colombia in April and didn't even know it was the prison. I was there for a hike (down the path he escaped from) to a place called Angel Falls. Just now realizing that I was there after watching this video. I even have photos with the helipad because I thought it was cool... (I understand after being in Colombia that Pablo was way more evil than he is shown on Netflix, and I do not in anyway think it's good to give him fame he doesn't deserve)"
6780,bXUcnFuvqcE,you accidentally showed his face at 1:43
6781,bXUcnFuvqcE,Hello merfi

6783,qkrJulbUA3U,"Love how the one chick, who doesn't understand basic words in english, couldn't have had it explained any more simplistically and she's still confused. She clearly doesn't know how to differentiate between a weird request versus not understanding the word someone just said😅😅😅😅😅"
6784,qkrJulbUA3U,"Maybe it's just me, but I can't even watch the ones where they don't travel. I just find them boring AF"

6787,qkrJulbUA3U,"I loved this video, I love the bond you guys have with each other. It's vulnerable, honest and funny all in one. I love how you repeatedly show that you find your tribe out in the world by following your vibe!!!"
6788,qkrJulbUA3U,Austin now is dating camilla cabello and i knew i recognized him before

6843,PAZ8Eu5MbP4,"Developing countries don't need unskilled, trainable-in-a-day labour like this. They need money, political stability and highly skilled professionals like doctors, public health specialists etc. This looks like a typical voluntourism trap and I hope the boys learned a thing or two since then."

6887,o9Bs6Pl2W_U,Now I understand why Amar always have problem with immigration/pasport
6888,o9Bs6Pl2W_U,"Watching these Egypt episodes and the episode where Thomas and his dad had matching tattoos just showed me how much sons need approval and validation from in their fathers eyes. I don't know how  to explain it but I could see it in Thomas' eyes, and now I see it also in Amar's eyes."

I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for making yourself so vulnerable in your videos. It is so tough when our parents don’t understand our lives. But you are choosing love in everything you do and I bow to you in deep gratitude and respect. ❤️"

6899,o9Bs6Pl2W_U,"I’m confused, the way it’s portrayed isn’t this similar to draft dodging? My point is will he get in trouble when he returns to his home with the military?"
6900,o9Bs6Pl2W_U,Did his brother have to serve instead?
6901,o9Bs6Pl2W_U,"I'm in tears, you'll be okay ❤️‍🩹"

6944,PnsOZ8JgTC8,"As a new subscriber in 2022:

I've seen comments saying the channel is turning into more of a documentary channel. Seeing this 5 years later, it's clear that the documentary aspect has always been there just with less focus..."
6945,PnsOZ8JgTC8,Egypt  the beauty in a country ...the first state in the world and the first empire in the world ....i hope the pharores our ancestor rise again to fix what we had made in that country

6949,PnsOZ8JgTC8,"Egypt is next for me, I'm 5 years with MDS and I didn't think I would make it long enough to go. We stayed with in a Bedouin camp in Jordan near Petra and we were treated very nicely, and I think it would be beautiful to experience that again. 
If anyone reads this and can recommend unusual things to do in Egypt I would love to hear it, we are currently looking at our options and figuring out what we can do in the time we have, will be about 2 or 3 weeks. Also, we will be there over the Christmas holiday, unfortunately with my condition I can tolerate the cold much easier than I can tolerate the heat. I'm having trouble in Houston, so I can't imagine Cairo in the summer."

6957,PnsOZ8JgTC8,"How do you find nomadic desert people and join them like this?   Especially the Bedouin Ive always found their life style rich, I always wanted to just volunteer helping a group and learn their ways/language through helping maybe even stay/live with them for awhile earn my keep just helping... just feed me and teach me.    simple life sounds like paradise....

Im assuming just travel to The Jordan Desert and hope you run into them... and find one that speaks some English or can understand you wanna follow them."

6985,dJZjgO67mFk,sad twat
6986,dJZjgO67mFk,Let's get real here. There's other people who got legal permission to climb to the top of the Great Pyramid. I know people personally who did that. This is simply a crazy exaggeration.
6987,dJZjgO67mFk,I hope you never get to desecrate the Mer of Khafre for your own karmic good 👍
6988,dJZjgO67mFk,So you didn't actually climb the pyramids then. Click bait. thanks
6989,dJZjgO67mFk,"I just saw a video of a German tourist illegally climbing the pyramid, and I saw the yes theory video and was like, hell ya of course yes theory did it too. but legally"
6990,dJZjgO67mFk,You never heard the saying i gotta see a man about a horse 😂weed joke if you know
6991,dJZjgO67mFk,Where is the damn climbing?!
6992,dJZjgO67mFk,💚
6993,dJZjgO67mFk,I flicked through this looking for some pyramid climbing.  So why does he have the permit?
6994,dJZjgO67mFk,people used to have picnik's on the top haha
6995,dJZjgO67mFk,"sorry about this but Egypt sucks for tourism, you can pay the cops to let you climb it. all the authorities just want your American money."
6996,dJZjgO67mFk,"You had all the permits you needed to climb.  You should have climbed anyway as other YouTubers have illegally, and once you were arrested you would have been let go after they saw your permits.  Let's use our heads and not our hearts."
6997,dJZjgO67mFk,My great Pop climbed that in 1915
6998,dJZjgO67mFk,How freaking beautiful would that be! This world amazes me more and more every single day.
6999,dJZjgO67mFk,Why does anyone wants to do that
7000,dJZjgO67mFk,"Does anyone know why the Pyramid of Giza is in Giza, Egypt???"

7010,MxBfxLrcUtQ,That is a beautiful place you grew up.
7011,MxBfxLrcUtQ,"It's a beautiful house!  Lovely family.   So, is this video after or before the father told him not to come back if he does not leave Yes Theory?   I hope this is after, and that they have reconciled."
7012,MxBfxLrcUtQ,Man you guys are so amazing I wish I can indeed do what you do but can't as I've made mistakes in my life that make it to where I can't leave America to my understanding but love you guys ty so much for content

Just weird why he sounds less Egyptian than Egyptians who never lived in Egypt but who’s parents did until adulthood and only speak Arabic and their foreign born and raised kids sound more Egyptian/Arabic..ya know🙂 I know he’s being honest, but it’s still weird. And the way those people treat foreigners, I mean not if you’re only acquaintances, but if you wanna be close.. they’ll disown their own children for loving a non-Arabic of the same faith😔"

7044,AMeKhbRk_Uw,148
7045,AMeKhbRk_Uw,I was in rehab when Havey hit but I got out september 1st and the first thing I did was book a flight to houston to see what i could do yo help. A firefighter recognized my tshirt I was wearing that I was in EMS. He talked to me about joining their dept and within 2 weeks I had a job on the rig in northeast Houston. Its funny because watching the news and being from georgia I would had never thought hey I could be one if those first responders that are helping. But there I was with a job in hand and I've never looked back to opioids again
7046,AMeKhbRk_Uw,"I know im a bit late but u guys r great. i live in china and now i got to deal with this new virus going around. nice to hear ppl coming together to help one another while here some ppl who have symptoms still travel around and brag about it online while others sell face masks for stupidly overpriced amounts of money/canceling orders cuz others offered more money. 
i understand that not everyone here is like that but the fact that i keep reading/hearing stories like that is sad as hell cuz i just wish that those ppl would simply have some basic human decency and not put the lifes of others at risk or try to make a handsome profit in a time like this"
7047,AMeKhbRk_Uw,Ammar i really thankyou for being who you are.....i love you boys....

I am only about 1 hour away from Rockport and my town was damaged but Rockport was destroyed. It has been almost a year and they are still trying to recover. Look up the pics.

7143,b4RsZXuleKM,My biggest fear is the fear of heights.
7144,b4RsZXuleKM,"My biggest fear is being forgotten. I’m afraid that I’m always trying to blend in and when I die, there will be nothing to remember me by. I want to create something, an art piece or a charity or anything really that will live on after me for people to experience, so I can leave my mark on this planet."
7145,b4RsZXuleKM,😲
7146,b4RsZXuleKM,My greatest fear is failing
7147,b4RsZXuleKM,UR EVERYWHERE
7148,b4RsZXuleKM,"My biggest fear ever is Snakes. Yes, SNAKES!!! Help me overcome it?"
7149,b4RsZXuleKM,Yay!
7150,b4RsZXuleKM,"I really thought hard of this and I come to that point were i don't know what my biggest fear is. I am to scared off hights or juping, or some dangerous animals. I think I am afraid of beeing rejected in any possible way and a have to learn to deal with it. 😬"
7151,b4RsZXuleKM,i’m scared of peanuts
7152,b4RsZXuleKM,My greatest fear is having an orgy with alot of female pornstars I wouls Love you to be helping me.😅
7153,b4RsZXuleKM,"done
my biggest fear is a tarantula"
7154,b4RsZXuleKM,My biggest fear is drowning in the ocean.
7155,b4RsZXuleKM,"My biggest fear is not being able to do stuff when I’m alive. As a 14 year old kid, you may think that ‘it’s just school shit’ and I’m not asking for pity or anything since I know everyone in school will go through something similar. School is mentally and physically draining, having 17 subjects and each of them requires grades for tests, homework, projects and many more each term. I know I’m still 14 and ‘life is still long’ but no. Life is short. I’m about to end school in probably 3 more years or even less and my thoughts are filled with ‘what have I always wanted to do in school’ because after a few more years, I couldn’t do anything else I always wanted in school. Ex. I have always wanted to experience going to school in Japan, but there isn’t any time for me to do so. I couldn’t possibly miss school for even a month since each year is ended with a very important exam and I wouldn’t want to miss any lesson. As in this case, even if I’m a billionaire, I couldn’t solve it, unless i decided to just fuck up my grades. Another problem is that I couldn’t speak Japanese and  it’s a really hard language to learn. I would write long ass essay about my fears but no one is gonna be interested anyways."
7156,b4RsZXuleKM,"you are THE ONLY channel that I follow on Snapchat
just that you know, WE CARE !"
7157,b4RsZXuleKM,"My biggest fear are spiders. Spiders. They are so, they are so spiders. Help. Plz."
7158,b4RsZXuleKM,"Love your channels energy, get shit done!"
7159,b4RsZXuleKM,"My biggest fear is being trapped in a room full of snakes, Thats totally fucking scary"
7160,b4RsZXuleKM,"Heights 
Zip lines
Cliff jumping
Roller coasters"
7161,b4RsZXuleKM,I'm TERRIFIED of the dark. I can't walk down my own hallway without a flashlight. Whenever I have tried I always freak out and have a panic attack. Being outside when it's dark is even worse. I want to overcome this fear just because it's annoying. I love scary things and exploring abandoned places and such but I can't do it when it's dark(which is the best time am I right)
7162,8uvzimVM7n0,Hey @ElonMusk wanna make an exception and come discuss simulation theory with us in a hot tub? Comment what questions you think we should ask him when we meet him :)

7203,juG9S90XuRA,Did they end up seeing this video to get the experience gift ?
7204,juG9S90XuRA,"I don't understand how so many people in the comments are pissed with the groom, his reaction was to be expected, not everyone welcomes a stranger in special situations like this."

7210,juG9S90XuRA,"I've heard that crashing a wedding is extremely rude.

But that raises the following question:

If crashing a wedding is considered rude, why can't I find any results concerning how to apologise for doing so?"

7220,juG9S90XuRA,Try indian weddings
7221,juG9S90XuRA,"What a boring couple! They don't deserve for you guys to give them an epic experience. The way that groom kicked you guys out was plain rude and with no awareness.

Considering the options, and everyone has an opinion and everyone has an @$$ hole they all stink, but what sounds better. I did the same when I was 17, and left my home state, but didn't become YouTuber until I got my first car 3 years ago. (then again I'm still making videos and only at 47 subs, I'm ok w that, because it's the adventures my son and I go on, not the view count)
so back to the opinions, I'm still faced with that today. I wish I had friends like you guys. 
Thanks for making these vids, I'm going thru all your old stuff first, and I love it.

7311,_g6_yLNSg-c,Firstly I have to earn money for fun like this group...
7312,_g6_yLNSg-c,i’ve been showing everyone this video for the past 3 years. changed my entire life around following this theory.
7313,_g6_yLNSg-c,"2:59 ""If you were 99 years old and on your deathbed and you were given a chance to come back to today, what would you do right now""

Hey guys,

my name is Lucas. I am 21 years old and a little unknown DJ from Germany. I am really passionate about DJing, because I love to create certain vibes and love to see how people react and dance to the music I am playing. Last week I came back from an extended vacational trip in mexico. I was able to find a few gigs, so I could play at some parties. This experience made me realize that this is the one thing I want to do in my life; play music. I used to work in an office where I was depressed and did not enjoy life at all. This trip to mexico including the  ton of people I've met and experiences I've made, changed everything. I was thinking all the time whether I should go back for some time because apparently this is the place my heart is really craving for right now and the quote mentioned above finally made me book my flight back to cancun on next tuesday, because I feel like this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me! I'll see where this path leads me, hopefully to the most beautiful places on earth. I am so happy, excited but also scared at the same time. Nevertheless I cant wait to be on the airplane. This feels literally like a dream to me. 

Thank you @Yes Theory for encouraging me!

Anyone who might read this right now, take a leap of faith and actually start chasing your dreams. It could change your life!"
7314,_g6_yLNSg-c,thanks for this video
7315,_g6_yLNSg-c,"So cool! And still I can't find the skinny dipping video and the one with the wedding, some scenes are shown in this video. May someone help me to find that two?"
7316,_g6_yLNSg-c,"This is how you should want to live life, you guys are ridiculously inspiring!"
7317,_g6_yLNSg-c,Lack of breath makes me uncomfortable..I will learn to stop breath for 5 min than snorkel in the ocean
7318,_g6_yLNSg-c,"Remember: Life doesn't offer anyone free lunches. Don't say I never told you. Hard to immediately wake up to what has just imprisoned us until normally it is too late, if not for forever on a non return and non-forgiving shackles."
7319,_g6_yLNSg-c,i found myself crying throughout the video. YES theory inspires me to live my life to the fullest! so much love from the Philippines <3
7320,_g6_yLNSg-c,I am still dreaming about the day I will see Matt on Tinder and jump into their world..
7321,_g6_yLNSg-c,I always watch this video to remind myself that is never the end
7322,-2VPJHd_Ozs,"This reminds me of the 90s when I was a teenager, my mom and I would drive around and dare each other to do certain things in certain businesses and I remember I dared her to walk into a baskin-robbins, aggressively point at the case filled with ice cream scream as loud as she could ""what!????"" And then walk out😂. Then she dared me to walk into a liquor store and right inside the door scream ""I""m paranoid!!!!!!!"" And leave"
7323,-2VPJHd_Ozs,💚
7324,-2VPJHd_Ozs,Only Ammar can get a random group of people to hysterically laugh for no reason
7325,-2VPJHd_Ozs,❤❤❤
7326,-2VPJHd_Ozs,"6:39 The guy at the back was also filming Matt when he was laughing while lying on the ground 😂

Btw, it's great to know you guys are friends with Markian! Been watching some of his contents on fb for years! And the girl is a lucky fan!"
7327,-2VPJHd_Ozs,"😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I also started laughing hypothetically for no reason!"
7328,-2VPJHd_Ozs,This is the mood changing video!!
7329,-2VPJHd_Ozs,135th
7330,-2VPJHd_Ozs,"7:39 Damn, you scared the squirrel over there!!!"
7331,-2VPJHd_Ozs,What a crackhead 😂
7332,-2VPJHd_Ozs,When Matt was laughing I noticed that the dude behind him started filming
7333,-2VPJHd_Ozs,Should've laughed at Starbucks while looking at the prices 😂
7334,-2VPJHd_Ozs,Matt's laugh broke me 😂😂😂
7335,-2VPJHd_Ozs,First time a Video got me out of comfort zone hahaha
7336,-2VPJHd_Ozs,BAHAHA! I love the guy in the background trying to secretly film Matt 😂
7337,-2VPJHd_Ozs,I want to be surprised and get hugged like that from matt and the gang  2:37
7338,-2VPJHd_Ozs,"Matt's laugh had me laughing for 10 minutes straight, I literally started tearing up."
7339,-2VPJHd_Ozs,She actually killed the first one
7340,-2VPJHd_Ozs,"Dude, matts laugh is EXACTLY like christian crying over satine in moulin rouge!"
7341,-2VPJHd_Ozs,Matt just gave her the best hug ever!!!
7342,yrWscAWapc0,"hello, When will you visit in Mongolia? keep waiting"
7343,yrWscAWapc0,Here after the latest sumo video
7344,yrWscAWapc0,I keep distracted by your haircut XDXD
7345,yrWscAWapc0,👍👍👍👍
7346,yrWscAWapc0,This man crush goes a bit too far goe adults guys
7347,yrWscAWapc0,You guys are absolutely privileged to meet Asashōryū. The man is an absolute legend. He is no Hakuhō but still a legendary yokozuna nonetheless.
7348,yrWscAWapc0,They have to show their video with Canadian Prime Minister to talk to him. Japan has secrets
7349,yrWscAWapc0,Hakuho has like 400 more wins than him and like 30 more championships rofl.
7350,yrWscAWapc0,"I mean, he is a wrestler, hes going to be naturally aggressive and intimidating. I am glad he turned out to be a really cool person <3"
7351,yrWscAWapc0,Hakuho is the greatest of all time
7352,yrWscAWapc0,134th yes
7353,yrWscAWapc0,Last vertical
7354,yrWscAWapc0,"If Asashoryu hadn't retired, Hakuho would not be sitting at 45 yushos. That's not a dig at Hakuho, that's just a fact. Asashoryu was unreal as a rikishi. He was the only rikishi with a winning record against Hakuho: 15-14, including 3-1 in Playoff wins (also, 2 of Hakuho's wins were by henka, which if you don't follow sumo, it's when you avoid contact and step to the side, scoring what Japanese sumo fans consider a cheap victory)."
7355,yrWscAWapc0,"The greatest sumo wrestler of all time is Hakuho Sho, and he isn't Japanese, he is Mongolian and the Japanese can't stand that the GOAT isn't from their country. Yet, he is the greatest sumo wrestler that has ever lived, just check the time he has dominated Sumo elite for well over a decade and still going strong. He's beaten Asashoyu more times and Asashoyu has beaten him."
7356,yrWscAWapc0,Lmao I love when people call Ammar Habibi 😂❤️
7357,yrWscAWapc0,Almost got a sumo slap.
7358,yrWscAWapc0,He seems like he speaks English well
7359,yrWscAWapc0,"Asashoryo was very humble person he was kind, I remember those we've been talked as new beginner in Sumo Sport""He was smart and kind full of Respect and love..
From my deepest heart"" Congratulations "" always my"" Champion ""ever..❤❤❤🇯🇵🇵🇭🇲🇳"
7360,yrWscAWapc0,My question is who would even dare fight this guy.
7361,yrWscAWapc0,Asashoryu rulez!!! Nice haircuts btw lol

7387,clLwE1JK3N0,LOVE YOU GUYS <3
7388,clLwE1JK3N0,I am very lost you just walk over to the flight attendant and ask to go on a flight?
7389,clLwE1JK3N0,So how is this free? Standby is free?
7390,clLwE1JK3N0,"I don't believe it's as easy as you say.. so I just book a flight saying I want a stand by seat and if no one's in it before it takes off, I get it free?  Yeah right

Well I just looked it up and maybe that was true at one point but something I read that was from 2022 says it's no longer true.."
7391,clLwE1JK3N0,Well all i need to do is go to the airport and ask  flight attendant for  standby and wait?🤯
7392,clLwE1JK3N0,"I have heard that this arrangement is cancelled now, you can no longer get a standby ticket without first purchasing a ticket. Someone please tell me there is another way 🤦‍♀️"
7393,clLwE1JK3N0,Who can help with getting one way flight to la from Louisville for 23
7394,clLwE1JK3N0,Flight attendant dude sounds like Captain America
7395,clLwE1JK3N0,LoL
7396,clLwE1JK3N0,6:46 the force be with you???
7397,clLwE1JK3N0,OMG THIS WAS 4 YEARS AGO ALREADY??? FEELS LIKE YESTERDAY
7398,clLwE1JK3N0,"I'm only 3mins into vid and I can't believe how stand by works, I've only experienced it once. That's all I needed. But for free99 sounds like fun too. It's been too long since I flew. (I'm not that old hahaaa)"
7399,clLwE1JK3N0,How is that happened?
7400,clLwE1JK3N0,Just watched this again because I missed YES videos 😅 Any Flight Attendant friends out there? 🤣🤗 It's my dream to travel the world.

He walked out there with a “st. Patrick’s day” green t shirt, gym shorts, adidas, a piece of notepad and a pen.
Was escorted onto the field with different members of media outlets (all in suits) and then he met John Oliver lmao.
Same friend snuck onto the set of Transformers and took a piss next to Shia LaBeouf at the urinal"
7413,HzmTaIDGpLI,Being young white men help

7444,marOr6mJefE,"I think ""lost in his own lies"" is a pretty pithy summary line. In other words, with some cons there is a very menacing sense of intentional evil about them. With this guy, however (and I'm not justifying a thing, understand) it's more like he actually wanted to do some good things but got all mixed up in the process. Perhaps he lacked the humility to face up to his truth-bending methods and claims, and instead just ignored them in pursuit of his grand dreams."
7445,marOr6mJefE,I went there as well lol

7501,bKpS4m4Z28s,The channel and all of you are definitely successes!!!
7502,kUTYSyd3LR0,WORST VIDEO EVER. I WAS EXPECTING A REAL LAWLESS PLACE. ALL I SEE IS BORING NICE PEOPLE. DISAPPOINTED WITH THE VIDEO
7503,kUTYSyd3LR0,wow this is amazing
7504,kUTYSyd3LR0,❤❤❤❤
7505,kUTYSyd3LR0,Thanks guys!
7506,kUTYSyd3LR0,It is truly sad to read from so many grown people who think that they need other grown people to make laws for them en order for them to be able to make good choices.
7507,kUTYSyd3LR0,✨be here now do no harm help others be still close eyes listen to your breathing✨book recommend: TAO TE CHING by d.c.lau. 😊
7508,kUTYSyd3LR0,Slab city inspires me to make junk like metal pipes and pieces of wood useful.
7509,kUTYSyd3LR0,"I have watched videos of slab city before, every video I have seen shows that even though there are no laws, the city is unique and the people are welcoming. I think salvation mountain is the coolest part of slab city and one day would like to visit it"
7510,kUTYSyd3LR0,"Nice video. 

Maybe look up old maps to discover the real reason for the sand ( it’s not an experiment gone wrong like you stated right off the bat) 🤓"
7511,kUTYSyd3LR0,You have watched MrBeast
7512,kUTYSyd3LR0,Great video very interesting

7515,kUTYSyd3LR0,"I aspire to introduce myself like wizard does ""Well the first thing you've gotta know is that I'm certified insane. I have papers."""
7516,kUTYSyd3LR0,Why laugh when he says he's certified? He isn't trying to be cute. He is telling you something.
7517,kUTYSyd3LR0,"They’re only about 2 hours from San Diego and 1 hour from civilization and some good old fashioned apple pie. I had a secret spot nearby where I’d encounter the desert rats, and it was always pretty interesting to hear folks’ stories."
7518,kUTYSyd3LR0,"Idk man, If these folks were black, they would be portrayed as lazy and living in a homeless encampment. I wouldn't call this sort of lifestyle idylic by any means"
7519,kUTYSyd3LR0,7:25 ali g is that you?
7520,kUTYSyd3LR0,"lol... nowhere on the TV preview on u tube did it say Slab City. I clicked it and thought,  I bet it's Slab City...lol 
I've never been but I've been out near there. Someday I would like to take a trip over there.

Every u tube  video there has been very good. Their all different takes on the place."
7521,kUTYSyd3LR0,"I live nearby, we always go. Don’t go to the salton sea, it’s beautiful but contaminated, we locals never visit the sea. It’s hot here so don’t come during the summer, currently 119F. Come during the winter. :)
I can’t believe Yes Theory was here 😊"

7552,Ugw5ThfJeCI,👍🏻
7553,Ugw5ThfJeCI,Love the channel but I think you just missed the mark with this idea. Would love to see a yes theory travel club. Curated trip by y’all. The rest of the stuff will naturally follow by the people leading the trip and those who come
7554,Ugw5ThfJeCI,is it too late?
7555,Ugw5ThfJeCI,I've been here since day 1... hope someday they'll come here at the Philippines
7556,Ugw5ThfJeCI,"why cant the people there build the huts, it makes no sense, there problem is money not a disability, donating the materials is one thing but surely they would appreciate more if they built the homes themselves, i love Yes theory, but i doubt if id go if it was free but you have to pay to build peoples houses, nope this just seems wrong"
7557,Ugw5ThfJeCI,Turning 18 next year... man I really wanna travel

What's the toughest physical challenge you've ever gone through? This ranks pretty high for us... We want to hear yours, tell us in the comments! :)"
7563,6q63YArFL6A,"I am one of the new subscribers so far and YouTube recommended me this video before a couple of minutes and I was like: 'OK. let's watch it during my lunch break. And it had to be a fun one, right? There were the boys as well so it can't be a waste of time."" Well. IT WAS THE MOST HILARIOUS VIDEO by Yes Theory I have been watching so far.  I couldn't stop laughing and I can say that I have the YES Theory addiction officially as well 😂
If one of the boys sees this  - I Love you guys and can't wait to see more of you. Definitely, I currently manifest to meet at least one of you in person one day. You made my life better since I found your channel. 🤍"
7564,6q63YArFL6A,The stomach hitting really took it too far. Someone could have gotten hurt. There's intense training and then there's bad practice. Nobody should look up to this man.

7572,6q63YArFL6A,"Huh, I wonder why we don't see Jake Paul in more videos."
7573,6q63YArFL6A,From one video where they talk about being a better man and being feminists to a video where they use 'princess' and 'she' in a derogetary way lmao.
7574,6q63YArFL6A,The moment the Veteran called Devin a princess it was all over for the rest of the group 😂
7575,6q63YArFL6A,"Why they gotta kick and slap em😂

And why everyone in the comments hating on Jake Paul to such a degree lmao"

7580,6q63YArFL6A,Why is Thomas wearing his lemon pants during arduous training? this is funny princess!!!

7739,JR5942ZEEbY,I know the guy who spit on you he didn’t mean it he was just supporting

Am wondering what the record is.  The thing that I saw both times before was that nobody seemed interested in speed.  But your assent in the off season, too, looks interesting.  What date did you do it?"
7777,2No9bWWXgG4,"This showing up on my recommendations 3 years later and seeing what their ""crazier"" then meant and what now means is crazy  itself😂"

7808,XEYskDAsAn8,"Matt said that the most important thing in his life was friendship. I’d argue that it’s health. Question: would you rather have friends and be cripplingly chronically ill, or be perfectly healthy and have no friends. Think 50 years, not just a few…"

7834,jM1DQGyA444,you shold go at night
7835,jM1DQGyA444,"I am a paranormal skeptic beyond measure. First off you guys were feeding off of each others fear and paranoia.

Event
1. Hearing ""footsteps"" in the attic. Most likely a wild animal that was hiding once you opened the access door/steps or it slipped out through another hole.
2. Owner's apartment. People have been coming there for years being silly and propping things up for either a spooky effect or just being dumb.
3. Owners house. Hearing footsteps... another animal. Just think about the number of animals that have taken up refuge in these buildings.
4. Glitching equipment. Magnetic fields can easily affect a piece of equipment. I would recommend getting an expert in electronics that has some tools to look for fields that would affect camera equipment.

In summary, I believe that once you guys got creeped out that your fear made you seek illogical answers.

I would be willing to spend the night there to prove there are no ghosts, after making sure homeless people are not prevalent, that we get permission to do so. I would also want to confirm that the area is not being bombarded with microwaves (or electromagnetic energy), has something radioactive or a major health hazard. Just let me know when you want to go. :)"
7836,jM1DQGyA444,Probably full of asbestos
7837,jM1DQGyA444,Don't come here and yet your here 🐊
7838,jM1DQGyA444,Or we can choose to believe it didn't happen at all.
7839,jM1DQGyA444,Lmao. So dumb I have to change this
7840,jM1DQGyA444,Dusty.. you mean asbestos

7884,wB8MAZyd0VA,That's amazing that you guys got all that for free. I wanna know how much of the food and alcohol was left over after the party? 🎉
7885,wB8MAZyd0VA,"I'm new to watching your channel and have even subscribed, from what I've seen so far I like. I've watched a mix of recent adventures and some from 6 years ago including this one, which I'm sad to say was very disappointing. I mean I get the semi privileged ethnically homogeneous niche that you've successfully managed into a business with quite a following, good job! However, from what I can see this party appears to be lopsided with a token performer. Apologies if I'm mistaken."
7886,wB8MAZyd0VA,wow Boogie is trash

7949,s2wVl9tMZ5E,"I like Mr Trudeau very much, however, any discussion of masculinity that does not include the impact of homophobia on all men is ultimately pointless."
7950,s2wVl9tMZ5E,I guess Finnish PM Sanna Marin is about the only glowing existing human being politician that is STILL kind to the eyes of people. Until of course up to the point when she screws that up.
7951,s2wVl9tMZ5E,Worst PM in Canadian history. Hardly an inspiration.
7952,s2wVl9tMZ5E,Trudeau would have to be a man first before giving this advice.
7953,s2wVl9tMZ5E,Justin Trudeau is a role model? Well that aged really poorly
7954,s2wVl9tMZ5E,Trudeau must go
7955,s2wVl9tMZ5E,"I'm baffled by only 22k likes after 5 years of this interview.  I was extremely impressed by all of you.  Makes me want to move to Canada after listening to Prime Minister Trudeau.  
As always...
🧡"
7956,s2wVl9tMZ5E,Why don't you little boys go get castrated now before you pollute the  world.
7957,s2wVl9tMZ5E,How was the conversation with the devil? Justin is one evil human being.
7958,s2wVl9tMZ5E,Love you guys. But as a Canadian I can't watch this one.
7959,s2wVl9tMZ5E,Lol love the channel but Trudeau is a joke and a national embarrassment
7960,s2wVl9tMZ5E,"Saw this and Have to Unsubscribe, Justin Trudeau is a Narcissistic Dictator Puppet of the WEF."
7961,s2wVl9tMZ5E,taking tips on being a better man from the man women working for him have had to resign or be fired writing multiple books on the subject ya ok  calling Mr Trudeau is like putting an elevator in an outhouse
7962,wzU2lVyfy6Y,"Hey everyone, we hope you don't mind the vertical video too much. We were super nervous about uploading this but we also just REALLY wanted to share this crazy adventure from Japan with ya'll.. Thank YOU for watching! We love you all so damn much you have no idea <3"

7976,wzU2lVyfy6Y,Japan is listed as one of the most introverted countries in the world. I'm not surprised why you're having a hard time finding friends there.
7977,wzU2lVyfy6Y,Je savais pas que l'un d'entre eux est francais?!
7978,wzU2lVyfy6Y,The funny thing is: every main character in samurai anime/manga has normal hair while all the others have the chonmage haircut from the video. I wonder why.
7979,wzU2lVyfy6Y,"Respect the Chonmage, you're the worst stupids of all time"

8072,5qMOj37Z3aw,"Youtube security:
Were taking down a video because it showed 1% of a child's face without parent consent, which is a regulation of COPPA and we need to demonatize them

Yes theory makes a video literally called kidnapping strangers for 24 hours

Also Youtube security: whatever"
8073,5qMOj37Z3aw,"The final quote is so true, 
I wanted to go out from my comfort zone, One evening, i packed some stuff then went to the train station, not knowing where, I took a train to another country. I booked a hostel in a city on my way. I met a Mexican at the hostel and we had dinner in a restaurant like old friends and now we are planning to do rock climbing. It was a fantastic experience."
8074,5qMOj37Z3aw,Guys you guys are so spiritual
8075,5qMOj37Z3aw,Wow. And they thought they were going to have a boring 6 hour layover.  That was the perfect couple for this adventure.

- how to be confident , positive and friendly 
- most imp : FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS and THE WORLD IS UNITED 

Inspirational stuff , big thank you !!!"

8120,qwi8pBhzvX4,"Also I know I just left another comment about something else but I just had to say that just because someone drives a Prius does not mean that they don't have a private jet my cousin it's like 70 so it feels weird to call my cousin so call my uncle he's actually a millionaire and him's houses in different countries and everything else and he was snap up shirts in blue jeans and drives a dodge ram pick up truck everybody always thinks he's poor wherever he goes but he carries 15,000 a time and it's briefcase guess what I'm trying to say is don't judge a book by its cover"
8121,qwi8pBhzvX4,I haven't even gotten more than a minute and three seconds into your video by the way I love your videos and you're already telling me that Omar is like my mother my mother would lose her head if it wasn't connected to her body she loses everything I can give her something like a pin to write something with ass K where's my pen and she's like I don't know I lost it within 10 seconds of getting it it's insane how their people like that out in the world and somehow they survive

8123,e28dvalxUks,"💚I've been binge watching for over a month, can't stop telling people about Yes Theory & Seek Discomfort.  
Since I live in Zion National Park, naturally, I have hiked Angel's Landing a LOT over the past 30 years.  But...I had to be in the right frame of mind to run it, without holding onto the chains (NO I do NOT recommend doing that!), and barefoot.  And some days I couldn't do it.  Same with arm wrestling, jumping in frigid Lake Tahoe, rappelling, and jumping off of a rock into the Virgin river (in ZNP).  I do want to do something uncomfortable next week for my 60th birthday....not sure what it is yet."
8124,e28dvalxUks,Gosh! This is even crazier than the Will Smith heli-bungee! Wow! Poor Derin...😂😂😂

8180,HrmGMg5YkHE,"This just in ‘4 you tubers killed while having band practice in tesla’... haha, awesome car. Love the lambo doors!"
8181,HrmGMg5YkHE,"Not to be the bitch or anything, but you shouldn't endanger civilists for a youtube Video, and create a Video that seems to have the message that it's okay to do that as long as you're doing it for a Youtube Video. (I didn't watch the video all the way through yet)"
8182,BOSn7vX-iOg,The video made my day:)
8183,BOSn7vX-iOg,i wonder why i cant figure out the skinny dipping episode of yes theory???? is it there or been taken out?? someone please help!!
8184,BOSn7vX-iOg,thomas is too cute
8185,BOSn7vX-iOg,I'd love to go for these but the question is my friends aren't going to do this with me rather they will go themselves with the girl😂
8186,BOSn7vX-iOg,💚
8187,BOSn7vX-iOg,"Ammar, your excitement for Thomas is so beautiful. Your joy is infectious. Love your sweet soul. ❤️"
8188,BOSn7vX-iOg,Love it
8189,BOSn7vX-iOg,"All great and good looking lads, but I choose Amarr <3"
8190,BOSn7vX-iOg,Love samiras vibe.
8191,BOSn7vX-iOg,"Just wondering if they/you still read 100% of the comments. (I came to this video late, as as an ace it didn't really speak to me. ;) )"
8192,BOSn7vX-iOg,This was emotional for me how hert touching
8193,BOSn7vX-iOg,Sorry I’m so late on this. Just found out about you cats!! Love watching
8194,BOSn7vX-iOg,Nice job Thomas
8195,BOSn7vX-iOg,where is their video doing skinny dip? cant find it
8196,BOSn7vX-iOg,صراحتا ابداع
8197,BOSn7vX-iOg,Julia sounds exactly like Scarlett Johansson
8198,BOSn7vX-iOg,Where is the skinny dipping video
8199,BOSn7vX-iOg,"You should do an abandoned challenge with Thomas in a random location far away, and unfamiliar, then set him up on a blind date. Then have someone go somewhere random, find a stranger and convince them to go on a blind date with thomas at his random location."
8200,BOSn7vX-iOg,"Jesus, Thomas did change a lot!"
8201,BOSn7vX-iOg,Samira would be a perfect match for Matt. He likes Aussie girl right? The chemistry is there while AMMAR interviewing Samira and Matt is looking at her. I feel ❤️
8202,fpbaAzM8xLc,"""the ceiling is likely to collapse""

""yeah let's go inside"""
8203,fpbaAzM8xLc,love the old veideo of yes .. they still together is soulful
8204,fpbaAzM8xLc,Is there a story about this old town
8205,fpbaAzM8xLc,"Could this place have been used as a training ground ?
Or a fake news set ?"
8206,fpbaAzM8xLc,All I see is a perfect place for the homeless drug issue in CA. Get help or get shipped there.
8207,fpbaAzM8xLc,"u guys rock,but bein i ive 20 minutes from ferguson missouri we in florissant  missouri we dont support criminals like blm,we r alm,so ty for telling us vets u support blm"
8208,fpbaAzM8xLc,I challenge Mr beast to renovate this town and move all the homeless ppl from Los Angeles there
8209,fpbaAzM8xLc,Yo! Eagle Mountain just sold for $22M.
8210,fpbaAzM8xLc,This might as well be a private video since nothing was learned watching this. Waste of time.
8211,fpbaAzM8xLc,I lived at 802 palo verde
8212,fpbaAzM8xLc,"Hi, I grew up in Eagle Mountain California.   It was a great time living there.  The blood on the walls of the elementary school are from a movie shoot.  But it is fun to look around"
8213,fpbaAzM8xLc,I can't stop laughing! These guys are nuts!🤣😅🤣
8214,fpbaAzM8xLc,"So far it looks like a fun video. But if you're so worried about being spotted, why would you walk right down the middle of the street?"
8215,fpbaAzM8xLc,Cool setting for a zombie movie.
8216,fpbaAzM8xLc,What's the name of the town?!
8217,fpbaAzM8xLc,location of this town ?
8218,fpbaAzM8xLc,You guys are brainless shytes! How about someone comes to your house & just camps out without your permission? Hope you go to jail! And yes! They can still charge you. This is evidence. Duh!!!
8219,fpbaAzM8xLc,Eagle mountain desert center ca
8220,fpbaAzM8xLc,"I liked watching this video over and over back in middle school lol, finally found it after like 4 years :)"
8221,fpbaAzM8xLc,Oh how glorious it would be to have a large scale airsoft Milsim here. Could easily accommodate 2000 people here.
8222,v6hmlzM0muE,"This was heartbreaking and heartwarming all at the same time, kodus to those who took the courage to share and helped me realize im not alone in my thoughts ❤❤❤"
8223,v6hmlzM0muE,"By sharing the depths of what makes us human, we find that we have so much more in common to connect over than we think ❤"
8224,v6hmlzM0muE,My biggest is insecurity is my parents finding out about my sexuality
8225,v6hmlzM0muE,Hey y'all just another human being with insecurities. My biggest insecurities is I am afraid of being vulnerable or allow others to see me as weak & afraid of not being good enough for the people I love. I have never chosen anyone who loves me for me but instead push them away cuz fear they'll be disappointed by the end of day :)
8226,v6hmlzM0muE,My biggest insecurity is that I'll never be accepted for who I am.
8227,v6hmlzM0muE,My biggest insecurity is feeling worthless and insignificant
8228,v6hmlzM0muE,What you do it touches my heart 💖.  .. thank you!!
8229,v6hmlzM0muE,Road to 10 million ❤️
8230,v6hmlzM0muE,Powerful video! More of this Yes Fam ❤️🤠👏🏻

8232,v6hmlzM0muE,Thank you guys for all the good work you do in the world.  You guys make a very meaningful difference on this planet.  Love you guys.
8233,v6hmlzM0muE,faith in humanity restored.
8234,v6hmlzM0muE,I can't believe Thomas's girlfriend dumped him...i am in love with him ❤️❤️...i wish i can meet him... 😊
8235,v6hmlzM0muE,LXXXVII
8236,v6hmlzM0muE,"my biggest insecurity is that i think im gonna turn out to be a loser. i was very good in school and then the sparkle just... turned off? it makes me think that everything i was capable of in school was fake. i am insecure thinking what if i never feel good and proud of myself, never feel like i have achieved something."
8237,v6hmlzM0muE,My biggest insecurity is i dont have dream like any normal people have.
8238,v6hmlzM0muE,This made me smile wide
8239,v6hmlzM0muE,Im not crying 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
8240,v6hmlzM0muE,My insecurities are my looks and my political views I’m a conservative but I feel like I can’t say anything or else I get hate for being a conservative and I get called a trumpie but I didn’t vote for trump I voted for the Republican Party I didn’t vote for him as a person also I am insecure about my sexuality Bc I’m straight but nowadays you get hated for being straight and I am a firm believer in god and once again I get hated for that so I feel like nothing I say is right
8241,v6hmlzM0muE,"wow 😲

I can't believe this is a 2016 video, and I'm watching it in 2021"
8242,3El_OdbaXjA,This is definitely my favorite YES Theory video. Please make a part 2 & 3
8243,3El_OdbaXjA,Guys can do this sure.  Other way you might get creeps ladies.
8244,3El_OdbaXjA,girls are cute
8245,3El_OdbaXjA,"That's great that you met a lot of decent strangers along the way, but typically not everyone is that friendly!"
8246,3El_OdbaXjA,i binge-watching all the yes theory videos :)
8247,3El_OdbaXjA,-_-
8248,3El_OdbaXjA,"So sad I was not working at the Tour Eiffel anymore when you showed up for this visit. I may not be the best ""keeper"" type of guy, but I sure know how to take someone on a tour from the bottom all the way to the top of this unique and outstanding monument. You don't know what you've been missing !  lol 😉
What a funny one this video was, the ultimate ""how spontaneous are you ?"" idea !  Then, all your online-matches seem so cool and generous."
8249,3El_OdbaXjA,"Imagine making a tinder profile, hoping to find a ""serious"" relationship, then got matched with Matt/Ammar.. But they're actually just ""mass dating"" for their travel 😅💔"
8250,3El_OdbaXjA,"I would totally host you two in my appartment in Paris, the energy’s you radiate even on pictures is more contagious than COVID"
8251,3El_OdbaXjA,Staying in strangers houses doesn’t sound like a good idea
8252,3El_OdbaXjA,Now try this being ugly 😝
8253,3El_OdbaXjA,But did he put it in???
8254,3El_OdbaXjA,Missing this kind of content🥺
8255,3El_OdbaXjA,"Pal I'm afraid your the official wingman, shit happens and you just have to, suck it up  😂"
8256,3El_OdbaXjA,"Naive content can really get you in hot water. Not evrybody can get away with this.  But they going to try anyway , thanks to irresponsible content creators . It's dangerous! People please don't follow these knuckle heads !"
8257,3El_OdbaXjA,super original channel! love u guys from mexico!
8258,3El_OdbaXjA,you can also use couchsurfing ;-)
8259,3El_OdbaXjA,This may be my favorite one
8260,3El_OdbaXjA,LXXXVI
8261,3El_OdbaXjA,I see the point of this video them helping you out of generosity  but I would hope you at least gave the woman some kind of payment  back at the end of the videos for helping you all out
8262,7TosfvnclFM,Yeh the Google map was probably upset down.
8263,7TosfvnclFM,The resort you were looking for is the xpuha palace. I went.tgere last week swam with manatees and jumped in the lagoon..it's still abandoned and guarded. Pretty sure something sketchy goes on there. It was beautiful and amazing!
8264,7TosfvnclFM,"Count Your Blessings !!! 💕💕💕

I know this was filmed 5 years ago, you probably didn't know better. 😔

You all could have been EASILY killed and buried there and , TRUST ME on this one, NOONE WOULD HAVE EVER KNOWN what happened to you ! 🤦

YOU'RE VERY LUCKY  OR God Protected you ! 🙏🙏🙏"
8265,7TosfvnclFM,Gotta stop just listening and trusting random people...
8266,7TosfvnclFM,Maybe the cartel are storing drugs in the abandoned hotel so everyone just pretends that there is no hotel so people stop looking for it
8267,7TosfvnclFM,4:30
8268,7TosfvnclFM,Honeslt I'm surprised they haven't been killed yet (especially in Mexico)
8269,7TosfvnclFM,They're protecting one of Einstein's property.
8270,7TosfvnclFM,This is insane! I would’ve 💩 myself
8271,7TosfvnclFM,👍
8272,7TosfvnclFM,"Mexico is a beautiful country, don't get me wrong!
BUT, it's a country where it's notorious for gangs and violence, sadly. Just be careful"
8273,7TosfvnclFM,"I know this is old, but just to clarify, anyone on this earth can add places to google maps I literally added a coffee shop that doesn't exist, so I'm guessing someone just wanted to have fun and add a resort."
8274,7TosfvnclFM,i have watched like 100 project 30/gen y not/Yes Theory videos in 2 days i need a life
8275,7TosfvnclFM,I have no desire to go to Mexico matter fact I hardly have any kind of a desire whatsoever to ever leave the United States there is so much here to see you could spend your entire life going around just the United States
8276,7TosfvnclFM,"if you flip the phone before filming you will be amazed by the result........

lol, this is like watching something your parents filmed who are too dumb to not record in horizontal"
8277,7TosfvnclFM,Hahaha .. my kind of adventures 🤣🤣🤦‍♀️
8278,7TosfvnclFM,"Hey um, maybe dont do that next time?"
8279,7TosfvnclFM,LXXXV

8287,RElmOeyx7Fk,"i do have one peeve, disney is known to be pro peadophile, please stop giving disney attention, its full to the brim of predators"
8288,RElmOeyx7Fk,"As someone who does security for all of these premieres, those were well executed moves…minus the ticket. Forging tickets will never work. 

Btw, if you show up for events in LA uninvited more than once or twice, I can promise you you’ll be asked to leave before you can even make it within the event perimeter."
8289,RElmOeyx7Fk,Living on a road for some time

8315,wrz0mnq3MJo,Why was this video so short makes no sense

8320,wrz0mnq3MJo,"You HAVE to visit Fantasyland in the Philippines, an abandoned  theme park that was also made to be like Disneyland!  It now allows tourists to visit with a small fee, so you don't really have to 'break in'"

8383,LKQK0lud4fo,"You guys went like a month after TFIL
Im pretty sure you should watch their videos about it because some crazy stuff happened when they went,also its amazing to see other people on youtube find it"
8384,LKQK0lud4fo,"just be careful what you name your videos boys, police could technically arrest you for admitting you are breaking in"
8385,LKQK0lud4fo,I just realized that underground parking lot is where they filmed movies like tokyo drift
8386,LKQK0lud4fo,So many series and movie scenes have been filmed here. Cool place.
8387,LKQK0lud4fo,I was waiting for zombies entry
8388,LKQK0lud4fo,"ofc they had permission, I really doubt they would risk getting SHOT for a silly video
edit:: and posting the crime online :P"
8389,LKQK0lud4fo,79th yes
8390,LKQK0lud4fo,how did they not get caught? I would have made soo much noise lol
8391,LKQK0lud4fo,"Who is here in 2021, revisiting some old videos."
8392,LKQK0lud4fo,This is the mall where the teen wolf series recorded scenes
8393,LKQK0lud4fo,you guys inspire me and my siblings to break into places. then my brother got caught by the police 😅😅
8394,LKQK0lud4fo,Y'all are talking about different stuff in the comments abt the video..while I'm still thinking what a SUIC!DE ROPE WAS DOING IN AN ABANDONED MALL....
8395,LKQK0lud4fo,"Hears a cảt mèow, ""theres someone inside"" lmfao😂😂😂😂"

8399,LKQK0lud4fo,Is this where the Black Swan first MV shot?
8400,LKQK0lud4fo,Question is... why is there security in an abandoned place?

8682,BA7nrr7wiAA,That moment you dream about falling off a cliffs just to wake up and realize that you are falling off a cliff.
8683,BA7nrr7wiAA,"Damn, can feel adrenaline in me right now"
8684,BA7nrr7wiAA,Omg you guys are just mad😂 theres absolutely no way id do that. I felt really sick just watching this video😮
8685,BA7nrr7wiAA,"And what's the point of doing this? Other than tempting death, which sooner or later will collect.....smdh"
8686,BA7nrr7wiAA,Don't die.
8687,BA7nrr7wiAA,"I don't think I want to get over a fear of heights, that would just blind me to the threat, it isn't like a fear of public speaking, or asking a girl out, or standing up to a bully, all those pale in comparison. We have fears for a very good reason- to make us AVOID things like this. This isn't to say you shouldn't face any of your fears, but you think you're going to survive a fall from that height onto solid ground (even  on to water would kill you) the risk is always there no matter how many times you do it."
8688,BA7nrr7wiAA,Y’all out y’all dam minds
8689,BA7nrr7wiAA,Omigosh! I saw this as part of a meme and thought it was a hoax!!

8698,BA7nrr7wiAA,No I don't get it Why would you put your life to such dangers? Anything could happen. Strong wind could just whoosh you away.

9042,1lYPBwZdJ8U,"In all honesty we wish we had chosen this quote instead: ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that."" As someone eloquently put it below, the only way to solve this crisis is to ""recognize that they are human too. That they just got lost. There is still hope for them, to forgive, to love. If they can't, we will forgive and love for them."""

9285,1_tk332JTcs,"I would've hanged out with you guys in Montreal, knowing it was the starting point we probably walked pass eachother lol, IN MONTREAL REALLY 😂

I am nearly watching every single video you guys put out !!! You have such a beautiful friendship together, god bless Yes Theory!! Gosh I miss my friends!!

9289,1_tk332JTcs,"I was looking back on old videos and realised I've completely grown up watching you guys, as have many others... I started watching you all when I was 10, now I'm 15. That's crazy. What you guys have built here, your philosophy and attitude that has resonated with so many people... is crazy. I'm so privileged to be part of the Yes Fam: made up of such diverse, beautiful people from across the globe. It's random, and no one will read it, but it's crazy and I am lucky."
9290,1_tk332JTcs,"Everybody triggered that he was told to lose some weight. What do you think models were? Just average good looking guys? Honestly, it doesn’t mean he’s ugly, it just means he doesn’t perfectly fit into the beauty standard that is expected by these fashion designers. That’s all and that’s fair, since it’s the fashion designers decision. The capacity to understand that, is what we call self confidence. 

Anyways. The guy is beautiful, he was considered to walk in a fashion show. I’ll go find out, if he actually went."

9302,Q_tfqYtHWgc,"Just watched Project 30 from start  to finish. Having seen some of your more recent work as well, I am amazed at how much you guys have not changed. After 8 year you are still the goofy, funny, humble, loyal and loving friends you were in the beginning. Sure you are older now and have much more money to spend, but at the core you are the same, not allowing fame or fortune to corrupt you. For that you have my love and respect always."
9303,Q_tfqYtHWgc,I’ve been watching Yes Theory since 2018 and it’s crazy to see where they started and where they are at now. This is my first time watching Project30 all the way through and I’m so proud of these men and all the joy they’ve spread in the last 8 years. Thank you all for all you’ve done ❤️ seeking discomfort always
9304,Q_tfqYtHWgc,So… just discovered that yalls home is about 10 minutes from my home (on land).  Lol.  I grew up on the water as my families business is scuba diving.  How fun it would be to sail for a bit with y’all.  I can be ready in 10 minutes.

9738,xqCZixxXXH8,"I know I'm years late with this.  But, that woman either doesn't have a license, or she forgot everything about waxing.

Underarm hairs grow in at least 2 directions, so should take a minimum of 3 strips in different directions.

Just awful."
9739,xqCZixxXXH8,She is the most incompitent person I have ever seen do a waxing. I feel sorry for the guy.

9924,4EvWltiYNDU,"I am reading Matt’s book right now and after reading the chapter about how they made their first video together, I came straight here, impatient to see it. They’re so joyful, super contagious energy, it did not disappoint! It’s so heart-warming to learn your story and see how far you’ve gone. Yes Theory and Seek Discomfort gave me inspiration, freedom, bravery, and sparked my adventurous spirit. Thank you guys ❤"

9943,p1OjOD9vXO4,"Okay. Today is November 23, 2023. A week ago, I came across this channel and how I wish I found this channel years ago. Now, I came to the decision of watching all of your Videos. Here's to the very 1st video of yours! 🥂 (I already watched several videos these past few days tho. 😉)"
9944,p1OjOD9vXO4,"I was recently treated like trash by someone I fell in love with, and seeing the world at the moment, I've sort of lost hope and empathy for people. 

Then, I watched two videos from this channel, and it made me genuinely smile. Gonna watch all your videos from the start to restore my hope for love, humans, and connecting with one another. Let's see how many days it takes! ❤ 21/11/2023"
